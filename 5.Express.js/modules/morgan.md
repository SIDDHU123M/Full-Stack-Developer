# Morgan Middleware

The `morgan` middleware is a popular logging middleware for Express.js that provides detailed information about HTTP requests made to your server. It logs various details such as request method, URL, response status, response time, and more.

## Installation

To use `morgan` in your Express.js application, you need to install it as a dependency. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npm install morgan
```

## Usage

Once `morgan` is installed, you can require it in your Express.js application and use it as middleware. Here's an example of how to use `morgan`:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const morgan = require('morgan');

const app = express();

// Use morgan middleware
app.use(morgan('dev'));

// Your routes and other middleware

// Start the server
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

In the example above, we require `morgan` and use it as middleware by passing the `'dev'` parameter to `morgan`. This parameter specifies the log format. There are different log formats available, such as `'combined'`, `'common'`, and custom formats. You can choose the format that suits your needs.

## Log Formats

Here are some commonly used log formats in `morgan`:

- `'combined'`: Standard Apache combined log output format.
- `'common'`: Standard Apache common log output format.
- `'dev'`: Concise output format with colorful status codes.
- `'short'`: Shorter output format.
- `'tiny'`: Minimal output format.

You can also create custom log formats using predefined tokens or by defining your own tokens.

## Conclusion

The `morgan` middleware is a powerful tool for logging HTTP requests in your Express.js application. It provides valuable information for debugging, monitoring, and analyzing your server's traffic. By using `morgan`, you can gain insights into your application's performance and troubleshoot any issues more effectively.
