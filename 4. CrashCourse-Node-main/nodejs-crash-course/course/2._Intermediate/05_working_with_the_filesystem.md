# Working with the Filesystem

In this section, we will explore how to work with the filesystem in Node.js. We will cover reading and writing files, handling streams and buffers, and working with file permissions and directories.

## Reading Files

To read a file in Node.js, we can use the `fs` module. Here's an example of reading a file asynchronously:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('path/to/file.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return;
  }
  console.log(data);
});
```

## Writing Files

To write to a file in Node.js, we can use the `fs` module as well. Here's an example of writing to a file asynchronously:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

const content = 'Hello, world!';

fs.writeFile('path/to/file.txt', content, 'utf8', (err) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return;
  }
  console.log('File written successfully.');
});
```

## Handling Streams and Buffers

In Node.js, we can work with streams and buffers to efficiently handle large files. Here's an example of reading a file using streams:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

const readStream = fs.createReadStream('path/to/largefile.txt', 'utf8');

readStream.on('data', (chunk) => {
  console.log(chunk);
});

readStream.on('end', () => {
  console.log('File read successfully.');
});
```

## File Permissions and Directories

The `fs` module also provides methods for working with file permissions and directories. Here's an example of checking the permissions of a file:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

fs.access('path/to/file.txt', fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK, (err) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return;
  }
  console.log('File has read and write permissions.');
});
```

## Error Handling

When working with the filesystem, it's important to handle errors properly. Here's an example of error handling when reading a file:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('path/to/file.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Error reading file:', err);
    return;
  }
  console.log(data);
});
```

## Conclusion

Working with the filesystem is a common task in Node.js applications. By using the `fs` module, we can easily read and write files, handle streams and buffers, and work with file permissions and directories.

Remember to handle errors properly and follow best practices when working with the filesystem in Node.js.
