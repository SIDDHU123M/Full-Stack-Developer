- Different types of databases (relational, NoSQL) and their use cases.
- Introduction to MongoDB and PostgreSQL as popular database options for Node.js.

## Connecting to MongoDB using Mongoose

- Step-by-step guide to installing and setting up MongoDB.
- Introduction to Mongoose as an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB.
- Creating a connection to MongoDB using Mongoose.
- Defining models and schemas for MongoDB collections.
- Performing CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) using Mongoose.

## Connecting to Relational Databases using Sequelize

- Overview of relational databases and their advantages.
- Step-by-step guide to installing and setting up PostgreSQL.
- Introduction to Sequelize as an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Node.js.
- Creating a connection to PostgreSQL using Sequelize.
- Defining models and associations for database tables.
- Performing CRUD operations using Sequelize.

## Best Practices for Database Operations

- Handling database errors and implementing error handling strategies.
- Implementing data validation and sanitization to prevent security vulnerabilities.
- Using transactions for atomicity and consistency in database operations.
- Optimizing database queries for performance.
- Implementing database migrations for managing schema changes.

## Practical Examples
