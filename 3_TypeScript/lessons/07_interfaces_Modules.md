# Interfaces and Modules in TypeScript

## Overview
This lesson delves into interfaces and modules in TypeScript, both of which play critical roles in creating structured and maintainable applications. Interfaces help in defining contracts for objects and functions, enabling strong typing, while modules allow you to encapsulate and organize code into manageable units.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Understand the purpose and benefits of using interfaces in TypeScript.
- Implement interfaces to define object shapes and function contracts.
- Utilize optional, readonly, and indexable properties in interfaces to enhance type safety.
- Create and utilize modules to encapsulate, export, and import code effectively.
- Understand the role of namespaces in organizing code and preventing naming collisions.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Interfaces
An interface in TypeScript serves as a blueprint for an object, defining its structure, including properties and methods. Using interfaces promotes type safety and helps prevent errors by ensuring that objects conform to expected shapes.

- **Defining an Interface**:
```typescript
interface User {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    email: string;
}

// Implementing the interface
const user: User = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 25,
    email: "alice@example.com",
};
```

- **Implementing Multiple Interfaces**:
TypeScript allows a class to implement multiple interfaces, providing a way to enforce a contract on the class while promoting code reusability.

```typescript
interface Contact {
    phone: string;
    address: string;
}

interface User extends Contact {
    name: string;
    age: number;
}

const user: User = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 25,
    phone: "123-456-7890",
    address: "123 Main St",
};
```

- **Use Case**: Interfaces are beneficial in defining the shape of data, especially when working with APIs or data models. They enhance code readability and maintainability.

### 2. Optional and Readonly Properties
Interfaces can include optional properties, which are not required when implementing the interface, as well as readonly properties, which cannot be modified after initialization.

- **Syntax**:
```typescript
interface User {
    name: string;
    age?: number; // Optional property
    readonly email: string; // Readonly property
}

const user: User = {
    name: "Alice",
    email: "alice@example.com",
};

// Optional property can be omitted
const userWithoutAge: User = {
    name: "Bob",
    email: "bob@example.com",
};

// user.email = "new@example.com"; // Error: Cannot assign to 'email' because it is a read-only property
```

- **Use Case**: Optional properties allow for flexibility in object structures, while readonly properties enforce immutability, making it easier to manage state and data integrity.

### 3. Indexable Types
Indexable types allow you to define the shape of objects that can be accessed using an index, similar to arrays or dictionaries. This is particularly useful when working with dynamic data structures.

- **Example**:
```typescript
interface StringArray {
    [index: number]: string;
}

const colors: StringArray = ["red", "green", "blue"];
console.log(colors[0]); // Output: red
```

- **Use Case**: Indexable types are handy for scenarios where you want to create objects that behave like arrays or collections but with a defined structure.

### 4. Function Types in Interfaces
Interfaces can also describe the types of functions, defining how functions should be structured, what parameters they should accept, and what they should return.

- **Example**:
```typescript
interface GreetFunction {
    (name: string): string;
}

const greet: GreetFunction = (name) => `Hello, ${name}!`;

// Usage
console.log(greet("Alice")); // Output: Hello, Alice!
```

- **Use Case**: This enhances type safety when passing functions as arguments, ensuring that they conform to expected signatures.

### 5. Modules
Modules in TypeScript enable you to encapsulate code into separate files, promoting reusability and better organization. You can export and import functions, classes, or variables between different modules.

- **Exporting a Module**:
```typescript
// math.ts
export const add = (a: number, b: number): number => a + b;
export const subtract = (a: number, b: number): number => a - b;
```

- **Importing a Module**:
```typescript
// main.ts
import { add, subtract } from './math';

console.log(add(5, 3)); // Output: 8
console.log(subtract(5, 3)); // Output: 2
```

- **Exporting a Class**:
You can also export classes, allowing them to be instantiated in other modules.

```typescript
// user.ts
export class User {
    constructor(public name: string, public age: number) {}
}

// main.ts
import { User } from './user';

const user = new User("Alice", 25);
console.log(user.name); // Output: Alice
```

- **Default Exports**:
You can export a single value or class as the default export, which can be imported without curly braces.

```typescript
// calculator.ts
export default class Calculator {
    add(a: number, b: number): number {
        return a + b;
    }
}

// main.ts
import Calculator from './calculator';

const calculator = new Calculator();
console.log(calculator.add(5, 3)); // Output: 8
```

### 6. Namespaces
Namespaces allow you to group related code together, preventing naming collisions and organizing your code logically. However, with the introduction of ES6 modules, namespaces are less commonly used.

- **Example**:
```typescript
namespace Geometry {
    export const area = (width: number, height: number): number => width * height;
}

console.log(Geometry.area(5, 10)); // Output: 50
```

- **Use Case**: Namespaces can still be useful in certain scenarios, especially in environments where ES6 module support is limited.

### 7. Merging Interfaces
TypeScript allows interface merging, enabling you to define the same interface in multiple places, which can be useful for extending existing interfaces or libraries.

- **Example**:
```typescript
interface User {
    name: string;
    age: number;
}

interface User {
    email: string;
}

const user: User = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 25,
    email: "alice@example.com",
};
```

- **Use Case**: This feature is helpful for augmenting types when working with third-party libraries or extending existing type definitions.

### 8. Extending Interfaces
You can create a new interface that extends an existing one, allowing you to inherit properties and methods while adding new ones.

- **Example**:
```typescript
interface User {
    name: string;
    age: number;
}

interface Admin extends User {
    role: string;
}

const admin: Admin = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 25,
    role: "Administrator",
};
```

- **Use Case**: Extending interfaces promotes code reuse and helps create hierarchies in type definitions.
