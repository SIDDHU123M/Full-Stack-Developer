# 06.05. Aggregation Framework

## Overview of MongoDB's Aggregation Framework

The aggregation framework in MongoDB provides a powerful way to transform and analyze data within the database. It allows you to perform complex operations on collections, such as grouping, filtering, and calculating aggregate values.

## Using Aggregation Pipelines

Aggregation pipelines are the core concept of the MongoDB aggregation framework. A pipeline consists of multiple stages, where each stage performs a specific operation on the data. The output of one stage becomes the input for the next stage, allowing you to chain multiple operations together.

## Practical Example: Grouping and Summarizing Data

Let's say we have a collection of sales data with documents containing information about the product, quantity, and price. We can use the aggregation framework to group the data by product and calculate the total quantity and revenue for each product.

```javascript
db.sales.aggregate([
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$product",
      totalQuantity: { $sum: "$quantity" },
      totalRevenue: { $sum: { $multiply: ["$quantity", "$price"] } }
    }
  }
])
```

This pipeline stage groups the documents by the "product" field and calculates the total quantity and revenue using the $sum and $multiply operators.

## Exercise: Create an Aggregation Pipeline for Sales Data Analysis

Your task is to create an aggregation pipeline that analyzes the sales data and provides insights such as the average price, maximum quantity, and total revenue. Use the aggregation framework to perform the necessary calculations and transformations.

## Conclusion

The aggregation framework in MongoDB is a powerful tool for data analysis and transformation. By using aggregation pipelines, you can perform complex operations on your data and gain valuable insights. In the next lesson, we will explore working with Mongoose, an ODM for MongoDB.
