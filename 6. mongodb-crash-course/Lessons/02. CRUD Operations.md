# CRUD Operations

In MongoDB, CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations. These operations are fundamental to working with data in MongoDB. In this lesson, we will explore how to perform CRUD operations using MongoDB Shell and MongoDB Compass.

## Inserting Documents

To create new documents in a collection, we can use the `insertOne()` or `insertMany()` methods. Here's an example of inserting a single document:

```javascript
db.collection('users').insertOne({
  name: 'John Doe',
  age: 30,
  email: 'john@example.com'
});
```

## Querying Documents

To retrieve documents from a collection, we can use the `find()` method. We can also apply filters to narrow down the results. Here's an example of querying documents with a filter:

```javascript
db.collection('users').find({ age: { $gt: 25 } });
```

## Updating Documents

To update existing documents in a collection, we can use the `updateOne()` or `updateMany()` methods. We can specify the update operation using update operators. Here's an example of updating a document:

```javascript
db.collection('users').updateOne(
  { name: 'John Doe' },
  { $set: { age: 35 } }
);
```

## Deleting Documents

To remove documents from a collection, we can use the `deleteOne()` or `deleteMany()` methods. We can specify the deletion criteria using filters. Here's an example of deleting a document:

```javascript
db.collection('users').deleteOne({ name: 'John Doe' });
```

Now that you have learned the basics of CRUD operations in MongoDB, it's time to practice implementing a simple CRUD application. Good luck!
