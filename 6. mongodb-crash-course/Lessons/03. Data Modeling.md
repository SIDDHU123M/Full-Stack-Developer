# Data Modeling

In MongoDB, data modeling involves designing schemas for collections to efficiently store and retrieve data. In this lesson, we will explore the key concepts of data modeling in MongoDB and learn how to design effective schemas.

## Embedding vs. Referencing

One important decision in data modeling is whether to embed related data within a single document or to reference it using document references. Let's understand the differences between embedding and referencing:

- **Embedding**: Embedding involves nesting related data within a single document. This is useful when the related data is small and accessed together with the parent document. It provides better read performance as the data is retrieved in a single query.

- **Referencing**: Referencing involves storing a reference to related data in a separate document. This is useful when the related data is large or accessed independently from the parent document. It allows for better write performance as updates to the related data do not require updating all the documents that reference it.

## Practical Example: Modeling a Blog Post with Comments

Let's consider an example of modeling a blog post with comments using MongoDB. We can choose to embed the comments within the blog post document or reference them using document references.

### Embedding Example

```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId("60a7c3a8e8e4a7a7f8c9d1a1"),
  title: "Introduction to MongoDB",
  content: "MongoDB is a NoSQL database...",
  comments: [
    {
      _id: ObjectId("60a7c3a8e8e4a7a7f8c9d1a2"),
      author: "John Doe",
      text: "Great article!"
    },
    {
      _id: ObjectId("60a7c3a8e8e4a7a7f8c9d1a3"),
      author: "Jane Smith",
      text: "Very informative!"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Referencing Example

```javascript
// Blog Post Document
{
  _id: ObjectId("60a7c3a8e8e4a7a7f8c9d1a1"),
  title: "Introduction to MongoDB",
  content: "MongoDB is a NoSQL database...",
  comments: [
    ObjectId("60a7c3a8e8e4a7a7f8c9d1a2"),
    ObjectId("60a7c3a8e8e4a7a7f8c9d1a3")
  ]
}

// Comment Documents
{
  _id: ObjectId("60a7c3a8e8e4a7a7f8c9d1a2"),
  author: "John Doe",
  text: "Great article!"
}

{
  _id: ObjectId("60a7c3a8e8e4a7a7f8c9d1a3"),
  author: "Jane Smith",
  text: "Very informative!"
}
```

## Exercise: Create a Data Model for an E-commerce Application

Now it's time for you to practice data modeling. Imagine you are building an e-commerce application and need to design a data model for products, categories, and orders. Decide whether to embed or reference the related data and create the necessary schemas for the collections.
