# Introduction to MongoDB

## Overview of NoSQL Databases and MongoDB

NoSQL databases are a type of database management system that do not use the traditional relational model. MongoDB is one of the most popular NoSQL databases, known for its flexibility and scalability.

## Understanding the MongoDB Document Model

In MongoDB, data is stored in flexible, JSON-like documents called BSON (Binary JSON). These documents can have varying structures, allowing for easy schema evolution.

## Setting up MongoDB: Installation and Initial Configuration

To get started with MongoDB, you need to install it on your system. Follow the official MongoDB installation guide for your operating system. Once installed, you can configure MongoDB by modifying the configuration file.

## Practical Example: Create Your First MongoDB Database

Let's create our first MongoDB database. Open the MongoDB shell and run the following commands:

```
use mydatabase
db.createCollection("users")
```

This will create a new database called "mydatabase" and a collection called "users" within that database.

## Exercise: Insert and Query Documents in a Collection

Now that we have a collection, let's insert some documents into it and query them. Run the following commands in the MongoDB shell:

```
db.users.insertOne({ name: "John", age: 30 })
db.users.insertOne({ name: "Jane", age: 25 })
db.users.find()
```

This will insert two documents into the "users" collection and then retrieve all documents from the collection.

Congratulations! You have completed the introduction to MongoDB. In the next lesson, we will learn about CRUD operations in MongoDB.
