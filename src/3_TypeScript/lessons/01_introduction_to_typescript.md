# Introduction to TypeScript

## Overview
In this lesson, we will introduce TypeScript, a powerful language that builds on JavaScript by adding optional static typing. TypeScript allows developers to catch errors early during development, leading to better maintainability and enhanced code quality.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand what TypeScript is and its benefits.
- Explore how TypeScript enhances JavaScript development.
- Set up a TypeScript environment for development.

## Key Concepts
1. **What is TypeScript?**
   - TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It was developed by Microsoft to address the shortcomings of JavaScript in large-scale application development.
   
2. **Benefits of TypeScript:**
   - **Static Typing:** Helps catch errors during compile time rather than runtime.
   - **Improved Tooling:** Provides better autocompletion and code navigation features.
   - **Advanced Object-Oriented Programming Features:** Supports interfaces, generics, and access modifiers.

3. **Setting Up TypeScript:**
   - Install Node.js and npm if you haven't already.
   - Install TypeScript globally using npm:
     ```bash
     npm install -g typescript
     ```
   - Verify the installation:
     ```bash
     tsc -v
     ```

## Code Examples
### Compiling TypeScript
1. Create a TypeScript file, `hello.ts`:
   ```typescript
   const greeting: string = "Hello, TypeScript!";
   console.log(greeting);
   ```
2. Compile the TypeScript file to JavaScript:
   ```bash
   tsc hello.ts
   ```
3. Run the generated JavaScript file:
   ```bash
   node hello.js
   ```

## Summary
In this lesson, we covered the basics of TypeScript, its advantages over JavaScript, and how to set up a development environment. With TypeScript, developers can write more reliable and maintainable code.
