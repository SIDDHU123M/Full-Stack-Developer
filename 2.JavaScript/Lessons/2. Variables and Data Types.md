## File Descriptions

### Lessons

#### 1. Introduction to JavaScript.md

This lesson provides an overview of JavaScript, including its history, importance, and evolution. It explains how JavaScript interacts with HTML and CSS, the differences between client-side and server-side JavaScript, and provides examples of how JavaScript powers dynamic web pages. It also includes a practical example of basic JavaScript embedded into an HTML page to manipulate DOM elements.

#### 2. Variables and Data Types.md

This lesson explains variable declaration using `var`, `let`, and `const`. It provides a detailed discussion on JavaScript data types, including `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`, `Object`, `Array`, `Null`, `Undefined`, and `Symbol`. It covers best practices for using `let` and `const` over `var` and includes practical examples of creating variables and demonstrating type conversion and coercion.

#### 3. Operators and Expressions.md

This lesson provides an overview of different operators in JavaScript, including arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, and bitwise operators. It explains how expressions are evaluated in JavaScript, including precedence and associativity. It includes practical examples of performing mathematical operations, string concatenations, and comparison checks. It also includes an exercise to build a small calculator using operators.

#### 4. Functions.md

This lesson provides a detailed explanation of function declaration and expression. It covers the differences between regular functions, arrow functions, and anonymous functions. It explains higher-order functions and closures. It includes practical examples of function declarations, arrow functions, callback functions, and closures. It also includes an exercise to create a function that accepts another function as an argument (higher-order function).

#### 5. Objects and Prototypes.md

This lesson provides an overview of JavaScript objects and how they are created. It explains the `this` keyword and its behavior in different contexts. It dives deep into prototypal inheritance and how JavaScript handles object inheritance. It includes practical examples of creating objects using both constructors and the `class` syntax. It also includes an exercise to create a class hierarchy using the prototype model.

#### 6. Arrays and Iteration.md

This lesson explains how arrays work in JavaScript. It covers methods for manipulating arrays such as `push`, `pop`, `shift`, `unshift`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `forEach`, etc. It discusses the differences between array iteration methods and traditional loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`). It includes practical examples of array manipulation using different iteration techniques. It also includes an exercise to use `map` and `reduce` to transform and summarize data.

#### 7. Error Handling and Debugging.md

This lesson explains JavaScript error types, including syntax errors, runtime errors, and logical errors. It provides an overview of `try...catch` for error handling in JavaScript. It includes a practical example to simulate an error scenario and handle it using `try...catch`. It also includes an exercise to build a form validation script and add error handling for invalid inputs.

#### 8. Asynchronous JavaScript.md

This lesson provides an in-depth discussion on synchronous vs. asynchronous JavaScript. It gives an overview of callbacks, promises, and async/await. It explains how JavaScript handles asynchronous operations with the event loop. It includes practical examples of fetching data using both promises and `async/await`. It also includes an exercise to create a project that fetches data from an API and handles potential errors gracefully.

#### 9. DOM Manipulation.md

This lesson provides an overview of the Document Object Model (DOM) and how JavaScript interacts with it. It covers methods for selecting and modifying DOM elements such as `getElementById`, `querySelector`, `innerHTML`, `appendChild`, etc. It explains event handling using `addEventListener` and event propagation (bubbling and capturing). It includes practical examples of creating a dynamic webpage where users can add, remove, and modify elements using JavaScript. It also includes an exercise to build an interactive to-do list app with DOM manipulation.

#### 10. Modules in JavaScript.md

This lesson explains modularity and why it's essential for large-scale JavaScript applications. It provides an overview of different module systems such as ES6 modules (`import`/`export`), CommonJS (used in Node.js), and AMD. It includes a practical example of creating a small project using ES6 modules. It also includes an exercise to refactor an existing project to use modules, splitting the code into separate files.

#### 11. Advanced Topics.md

This lesson explains advanced JavaScript concepts such as closures, `this` binding, and `call`, `apply`, and `bind`. It helps in understanding the event loop and concurrency in JavaScript. It includes practical examples to demonstrate the `this` keyword and binding in different contexts. It also includes an exercise to build a custom function using `apply` and `bind`.

#### 12. Exceptional Knowledge - Popular JavaScript Modules.md

This lesson provides an overview of commonly used JavaScript libraries and frameworks, including Lodash, Moment.js, Axios, Jest, D3.js, and Three.js. It explains their usage and when to use them. It includes a brief description of each library and its purpose.
