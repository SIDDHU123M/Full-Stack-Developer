   - Overview of `try...catch` for error handling in JavaScript.
   - Practical example: Simulate an error scenario and handle it using `try...catch`.
   - Exercise: Build a form validation script and add error handling for invalid inputs.

8. [Asynchronous JavaScript](Lessons/8.%20Asynchronous%20JavaScript.md)
   - In-depth discussion on synchronous vs. asynchronous JavaScript.
   - Overview of callbacks, promises, and async/await.
   - How JavaScript handles asynchronous operations with the event loop.
   - Practical examples: Fetching data using both promises and `async/await`.
   - Exercise: Create a project that fetches data from an API and handles potential errors gracefully.

9. [DOM Manipulation](Lessons/9.%20DOM%20Manipulation.md)
   - Overview of the Document Object Model (DOM) and how JavaScript interacts with it.
   - Methods for selecting and modifying DOM elements: `getElementById`, `querySelector`, `innerHTML`, `appendChild`, etc.
   - Event handling: `addEventListener` and event propagation (bubbling and capturing).
   - Practical examples: Create a dynamic webpage where users can add, remove, and modify elements using JavaScript.
   - Exercise: Build an interactive to-do list app with DOM manipulation.

10. [Modules in JavaScript](Lessons/10.%20Modules%20in%20JavaScript.md)
    - Explanation of modularity and why it's essential for large-scale JavaScript applications.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, simply clone the repository and explore the lessons and code examples. Each lesson is self-contained and builds upon the previous ones, so it's recommended to follow the lessons in order. The code examples provide hands-on experience and can be used as a reference while working on the exercises.

Happy learning!
