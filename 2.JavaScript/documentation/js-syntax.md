# JavaScript Syntax

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for both frontend and backend development. It has a C-like syntax and is known for its versatility and flexibility. In this document, we will explore the syntax of JavaScript, including its lexical structure, expressions, and control flow.

## Lexical Structure

JavaScript programs are composed of a series of tokens, which include identifiers, keywords, operators, and punctuators. Here are some key aspects of the lexical structure in JavaScript:

- **Identifiers**: These are names used to identify variables, functions, and other entities in JavaScript. They must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($) and can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.

- **Keywords**: JavaScript has a set of reserved keywords that have special meanings in the language. Examples include `if`, `for`, `while`, `function`, and `let`.

- **Operators**: JavaScript supports a wide range of operators, including arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), assignment operators (=, +=, -=), comparison operators (==, ===, !=, !==), and logical operators (&&, ||, !).

- **Punctuators**: These are special characters used to separate tokens in JavaScript. Examples include parentheses (), curly braces {}, square brackets [], and semicolons (;).

## Expressions

Expressions in JavaScript are combinations of values, variables, operators, and function calls that produce a result. Here are some common types of expressions in JavaScript:

- **Arithmetic Expressions**: These involve arithmetic operators and operands. For example, `2 + 3` is an arithmetic expression that evaluates to `5`.

- **String Expressions**: These involve string concatenation using the `+` operator. For example, `'Hello' + 'World'` evaluates to `'HelloWorld'`.

- **Logical Expressions**: These involve logical operators such as `&&` and `||`. For example, `true && false` evaluates to `false`.

- **Function Call Expressions**: These involve calling a function with arguments. For example, `console.log('Hello, World!')` calls the `console.log` function with the argument `'Hello, World!'`.

## Control Flow

Control flow refers to the order in which statements are executed in a program. JavaScript provides several control flow statements, including conditional statements and loops.

- **Conditional Statements**: JavaScript has `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements for conditional execution of code. For example:

  ```javascript
  if (condition) {
    // Code to execute if the condition is true
  } else if (anotherCondition) {
    // Code to execute if the anotherCondition is true
  } else {
    // Code to execute if none of the conditions are true
  }
  ```

- **Loops**: JavaScript provides several types of loops, including `for`, `while`, and `do...while` loops. For example:

  ```javascript
  for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    // Code to execute in each iteration
  }

  while (condition) {
    // Code to execute while the condition is true
  }

  do {
    // Code to execute at least once, then repeat while the condition is true
  } while (condition);
  ```

These are just some of the key aspects of JavaScript syntax. Understanding the syntax is essential for writing correct and efficient JavaScript code.
