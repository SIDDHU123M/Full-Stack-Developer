# JavaScript Functions

Functions are an essential part of JavaScript and are used to encapsulate reusable blocks of code. In this module, we will explore various aspects of JavaScript functions, including function declarations, arrow functions, function expressions, and higher-order functions.

## Function Declarations

A function declaration is a way to define a named function. It consists of the `function` keyword, followed by the function name, a list of parameters enclosed in parentheses, and the function body enclosed in curly braces. Here's an example:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet('John'); // Output: Hello, John!
```

## Arrow Functions

Arrow functions are a concise syntax for writing functions in JavaScript. They are often used for shorter, one-line functions or as callbacks. Arrow functions have a more compact syntax and lexically bind the `this` value. Here's an example:

```javascript
const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;

console.log(multiply(2, 3)); // Output: 6
```

## Function Expressions

A function expression is another way to define a function in JavaScript. It involves assigning a function to a variable. Function expressions can be named or anonymous. Here's an example of a named function expression:

```javascript
const square = function(num) {
  return num * num;
};

console.log(square(4)); // Output: 16
```

## Higher-Order Functions

Higher-order functions are functions that can accept other functions as arguments or return functions as their results. They provide a powerful way to work with functions in JavaScript. Here's an example of a higher-order function:

```javascript
function applyOperation(a, b, operation) {
  return operation(a, b);
}

function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

console.log(applyOperation(2, 3, add)); // Output: 5
```

In this example, the `applyOperation` function takes two numbers and a function as arguments. It then applies the provided function to the numbers and returns the result.

## Conclusion

Functions are a fundamental building block in JavaScript. Understanding function declarations, arrow functions, function expressions, and higher-order functions will give you a solid foundation for writing JavaScript code.
