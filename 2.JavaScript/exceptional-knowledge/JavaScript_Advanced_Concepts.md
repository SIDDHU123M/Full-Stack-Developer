## Closures

A closure is a combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. It allows a function to access variables from its outer scope even after the outer function has finished executing. Closures are powerful and commonly used in JavaScript for encapsulation and data privacy.

Here's an example of a closure:

```javascript
function outer() {
  var outerVariable = 'I am from the outer function';

  function inner() {
    console.log(outerVariable);
  }

  return inner;
}

var closure = outer();
closure(); // Output: I am from the outer function
```

In the example above, the `inner` function has access to the `outerVariable` even after the `outer` function has finished executing. This is because the `inner` function forms a closure over the `outer` function's lexical environment.

## Prototypal Inheritance

JavaScript uses prototypal inheritance, which means that objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects. Each object has an internal link to another object called its prototype. If a property or method is not found on the object itself, JavaScript looks for it in the prototype chain.

Here's an example of prototypal inheritance:

```javascript
function Animal(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Animal.prototype.sayHello = function() {
  console.log('Hello, my name is ' + this.name);
};

function Dog(name, breed) {
  Animal.call(this, name);
  this.breed = breed;
}

Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog;

Dog.prototype.bark = function() {
  console.log('Woof!');
};

var dog = new Dog('Max', 'Labrador');
dog.sayHello(); // Output: Hello, my name is Max
dog.bark(); // Output: Woof!
```

In the example above, the `Dog` constructor function inherits the `sayHello` method from the `Animal` prototype using `Object.create`. This allows instances of `Dog` to access both the `sayHello` method and the `bark` method.

## Call, Apply, and Bind

The `call`, `apply`, and `bind` methods are used to manipulate the `this` value of a function.

- The `call` method invokes a function with a specified `this` value and arguments provided individually.
- The `apply` method is similar to `call`, but it accepts arguments as an array.
- The `bind` method creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` value set to a specific value.

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of `call`, `apply`, and `bind`:

```javascript
function greet() {
  console.log('Hello, ' + this.name);
}

var person = {
  name: 'John'
};

greet.call(person); // Output: Hello, John

greet.apply(person); // Output: Hello, John

var greetPerson = greet.bind(person);
greetPerson(); // Output: Hello, John
```

In the example above, the `greet` function is called with different `this` values using `call`, `apply`, and `bind`. This allows us to specify the context in which the function is executed.

## Event Bubbling and Capturing

In the browser, when an event occurs on an element, it can trigger the same event on its parent elements. This is known as event bubbling. Event bubbling allows you to handle events at a higher level in the DOM hierarchy.

On the other hand, event capturing is the opposite of event bubbling. It allows you to handle events at a lower level in the DOM hierarchy, starting from the outermost element and moving towards the target element.

Here's an example that demonstrates event bubbling and capturing:

```javascript
var parent = document.getElementById('parent');
var child = document.getElementById('child');

parent.addEventListener('click', function() {
  console.log('Parent clicked');
}, false); // Event bubbling

child.addEventListener('click', function() {
  console.log('Child clicked');
}, true); // Event capturing
```

In the example above, when you click on the `child` element, both the event capturing and event bubbling phases occur. First, the capturing phase triggers the event handler on the `child` element, and then the bubbling phase triggers the event handler on the `parent` element.
