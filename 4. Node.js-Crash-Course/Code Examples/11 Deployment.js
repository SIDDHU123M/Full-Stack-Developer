// This is an example of deploying a Node.js application to Heroku

// Step 1: Install the Heroku CLI and create a Heroku account

// Step 2: Set up your project for deployment
// - Create a new Heroku app using the Heroku CLI
// - Add a `Procfile` to specify the command to start your application
// - Commit your changes to version control

// Step 3: Deploy your application to Heroku
// - Push your code to the Heroku remote repository
// - Heroku will automatically build and deploy your application
// - Monitor the deployment process using the Heroku CLI

// Step 4: Configure environment variables
// - Use the Heroku CLI to set environment variables for your application
// - These variables can be accessed in your Node.js code using `process.env`

// Step 5: Scale your application
// - Use the Heroku CLI to scale your application by adjusting the number of dynos
// - Dynos are isolated containers that run your application

// Step 6: Monitor and troubleshoot your application
// - Use the Heroku CLI to view logs and monitor the performance of your application
// - Troubleshoot any issues that may arise during deployment or runtime

// Step 7: Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)
// - Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment process
// - Use tools like GitHub Actions or Jenkins to build, test, and deploy your application

// Congratulations! Your Node.js application is now deployed to Heroku.
