# Security Best Practices

In this lesson, we will cover security best practices for Node.js applications. We will discuss common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF, and learn how to prevent them. We will also explore authentication and authorization techniques using JWT and OAuth.

## Topics Covered

1. Common Security Vulnerabilities
   - SQL Injection
   - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
   - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

2. Authentication
   - JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
   - OAuth

3. Practical Example: Securing an Express Application
   - Implementing input validation and sanitization
   - Using secure session management
   - Protecting against CSRF attacks

4. Exercise: Review and Enhance Security Measures
   - Analyze an existing application for security vulnerabilities
   - Implement additional security measures
