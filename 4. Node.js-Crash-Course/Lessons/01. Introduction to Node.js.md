# Introduction to Node.js

In this lesson, we will introduce Node.js and cover its essential concepts and features.

## Node.js Architecture

Node.js is built on the V8 JavaScript engine and uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. This architecture allows for efficient handling of concurrent requests and scalability.

## Environment Setup

To get started with Node.js, you need to install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager). You can download the latest version of Node.js from the official website and follow the installation instructions. Once installed, you can verify the installation by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal.

## Creating a Basic Application

Let's create a basic Node.js application. Open your favorite code editor and create a new file called `app.js`. In this file, we will write our first Node.js program:

```javascript
// app.js
console.log("Hello, Node.js!");
```

To run this program, open your terminal, navigate to the directory where `app.js` is located, and run the following command:

```
node app.js
```

You should see the output `Hello, Node.js!` in your terminal.

## Node.js Event Loop

Node.js uses an event loop to handle asynchronous operations. This allows for non-blocking I/O and efficient resource utilization. Understanding the event loop is crucial for writing efficient Node.js applications.

## Practical Example: Create a Web Server

Let's create a simple web server using Node.js. Open your code editor and create a new file called `server.js`. In this file, we will use the `http` module to create a server that listens on port 3000 and responds with "Hello, World!" to all requests:

```javascript
// server.js
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.end('Hello, World!');
});

server.listen(3000, 'localhost', () => {
  console.log('Server running at http://localhost:3000/');
});
```

To run this server, open your terminal, navigate to the directory where `server.js` is located, and run the following command:

```
node server.js
```

You should see the message `Server running at http://localhost:3000/` in your terminal. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000/` to see the "Hello, World!" response.

## Exercises

1. Build a static file server using the `fs` module. The server should serve static files from a specified directory.
