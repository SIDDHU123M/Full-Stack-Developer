# Express.js Framework

In this lesson, we will explore the Express.js framework, which is a popular web application framework for Node.js. Express.js provides a simple and flexible way to build web applications and APIs.

## Setting up an Express Application

To get started with Express.js, you need to install it as a dependency in your project. Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory. Run the following command to install Express.js:

```
npm install express
```

Once Express.js is installed, you can create an Express application by creating a new JavaScript file and importing the Express module:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
```

You can now start building your application using the various features provided by Express.js.

## Middleware Usage and Routing

Express.js allows you to use middleware functions to handle requests and perform additional operations before sending a response. Middleware functions can be used for tasks such as logging, authentication, and error handling.

Here's an example of using middleware to log requests:

```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  next();
});
```

Routing in Express.js allows you to define different routes for handling different HTTP methods and URLs. You can use the `app.get`, `app.post`, `app.put`, and `app.delete` methods to define routes and their corresponding handlers.

```javascript
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, Express!');
});
```

## Error Handling in Express

Express.js provides built-in error handling mechanisms to handle errors that occur during request processing. You can define error handling middleware functions to catch and handle errors.

```javascript
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err);
  res.status(500).send('Internal Server Error');
});
```

## Practical Examples

To help you understand Express.js better, here are some practical examples:

1. Create a simple web application using Express.js.
2. Build an API with CRUD operations using Express.js.

Feel free to explore these examples and modify them to suit your needs.

## Exercises

To test your understanding of Express.js, here's an exercise for you:

1. Extend the chat application created in the previous lesson with user authentication. Implement a login system using Express.js and secure the chat functionality for authenticated users only.

Take your time to complete the exercise and feel free to ask for help if you encounter any difficulties.

That's it for this lesson on Express.js. In the next lesson, we will explore database integration in Node.js.
