# Core Modules Overview

In this lesson, we will explore the core modules in Node.js and learn how to use them effectively in our applications.

## Introduction to Core Modules

Node.js provides a set of core modules that are available out of the box. These modules offer various functionalities to help us build robust applications. Some of the key core modules include:

- `http`: This module allows us to create an HTTP server and handle HTTP requests.
- `fs`: This module provides file system-related operations such as reading and writing files.
- `path`: This module helps in working with file paths and directories.
- `os`: This module provides information about the operating system.
- `events`: This module allows us to work with events and event-driven programming.

## Using the `http` Module

The `http` module is one of the most commonly used core modules in Node.js. It allows us to create an HTTP server and handle incoming HTTP requests. Here's an example of how to use the `http` module to create a simple server:

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.end('Hello, World!');
});

server.listen(3000, 'localhost', () => {
  console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:3000');
});
```

In the above example, we create an HTTP server using the `createServer` method. We define a callback function that gets executed whenever a request is made to the server. Inside the callback function, we set the response status code, content type, and send a simple "Hello, World!" message as the response.

We then start the server by calling the `listen` method and specifying the port and hostname. Once the server is running, we log a message to the console.

By using the `http` module, we can easily handle HTTP requests and build powerful web applications in Node.js.

## Practical Example: Implementing a File Server

Now that we have learned about the `http` module, let's put it into practice by implementing a file server. The file server will allow us to serve static files to clients. Here's an example implementation:

```javascript
const http = require('http');
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  const filePath = path.join(__dirname, 'public', req.url);
  const contentType = getContentType(filePath);

  fs.readFile(filePath, (err, content) => {
    if (err) {
      if (err.code === 'ENOENT') {
        res.statusCode = 404;
        res.end('File not found');
      } else {
        res.statusCode = 500;
        res.end('Internal server error');
      }
    } else {
      res.statusCode = 200;
      res.setHeader('Content-Type', contentType);
      res.end(content);
    }
  });
});

server.listen(3000, 'localhost', () => {
  console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:3000');
});

function getContentType(filePath) {
  const extname = path.extname(filePath);
  switch (extname) {
    case '.html':
      return 'text/html';
    case '.css':
      return 'text/css';
    case '.js':
      return 'text/javascript';
    case '.json':
      return 'application/json';
    case '.png':
      return 'image/png';
    case '.jpg':
      return 'image/jpeg';
    default:
      return 'application/octet-stream';
  }
}
```

In the above example, we create an HTTP server and define a callback function to handle incoming requests. Inside the callback function, we first determine the file path based on the requested URL. We then use the `fs.readFile` method to read the file asynchronously. If an error occurs during file reading, we handle it accordingly by setting the appropriate status code and sending an error message. If the file is successfully read, we set the status code, content type, and send the file content as the response.

By implementing a file server, we can serve static files such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc., to clients.

## Exercise: Create a REST API with the `http` Module

Now that you have learned how to use the `http` module, it's time to put your knowledge into practice. Your task is to create a simple REST API using the `http` module. The API should have endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting resources.

Feel free to use the code examples provided in this lesson as a starting point. Good luck!
