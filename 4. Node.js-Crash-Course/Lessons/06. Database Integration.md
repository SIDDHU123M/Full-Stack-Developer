# Database Integration

In this lesson, we will learn how to integrate databases in Node.js. Specifically, we will cover connecting to MongoDB and PostgreSQL databases and performing CRUD operations.

## Connecting to MongoDB

To connect to a MongoDB database in Node.js, we can use the `mongodb` package. Here's an example of connecting to a MongoDB database:

```javascript
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

async function connectToMongoDB() {
  const uri = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase';
  
  try {
    const client = new MongoClient(uri);
    await client.connect();
    console.log('Connected to MongoDB');
    
    // Perform database operations here
    
    client.close();
    console.log('Disconnected from MongoDB');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error connecting to MongoDB:', error);
  }
}

connectToMongoDB();
```

In the above example, we use the `MongoClient` class from the `mongodb` package to connect to a MongoDB database. We specify the connection URI and use the `connect` method to establish a connection. After performing the necessary database operations, we close the connection using the `close` method.

## Performing CRUD Operations

Once connected to a database, we can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Here's an example of performing CRUD operations with MongoDB:

```javascript
// Assuming we are connected to a MongoDB database

// Create
const result = await db.collection('users').insertOne({ name: 'John Doe', age: 30 });
console.log('Inserted document:', result.insertedId);

// Read
const users = await db.collection('users').find().toArray();
console.log('All users:', users);

// Update
const result = await db.collection('users').updateOne({ _id: ObjectId('...') }, { $set: { age: 31 } });
console.log('Updated document count:', result.modifiedCount);

// Delete
const result = await db.collection('users').deleteOne({ _id: ObjectId('...') });
console.log('Deleted document count:', result.deletedCount);
```

In the above example, we use the `collection` method to access a specific collection in the database. We can then use methods like `insertOne`, `find`, `updateOne`, and `deleteOne` to perform the respective CRUD operations.

## Exercise: Full CRUD Application with Database

For this exercise, you are tasked with building a full CRUD application with a database of your choice (MongoDB or PostgreSQL). The application should allow users to create, read, update, and delete records from the database. You can choose the type of records and the fields they should have.

Feel free to use any additional packages or frameworks to assist you in building the application.

Good luck!
