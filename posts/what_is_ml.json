Uber, for example, uses algorithms to match drivers with riders. Google uses machine learning to surface the ride advertisements in searches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But machine learning comes with disadvantages. First and foremost, it can be expensive. Machine learning projects are typically driven by data scientists, who command high salaries. These projects also require software infrastructure that can be expensive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also the problem of machine learning bias. Algorithms trained on data sets that exclude certain populations or contain errors can lead to inaccurate models of the world that, at best, fail and, at worst, are discriminatory.
