This is a staggering amount of growth, both in absolute terms, as well as year-on-year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Machine learning makes a mockery of anything that can be called “important” – both at a financial as well as a global scale. If you are looking to take your career to another level, Machine Learning can do that for you. If you are looking to involve yourself in something that will make you part of something that is global as well as contemporary relevance, Machine Learning can do that for you as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Machine learning covers significant ground in various verticals – including image recognition, medicine, cyber security, facial recognition, and more. As an increasing amount of businesses are realising that business intelligence is profoundly impacted by machine learning, and thus are choosing to invest in it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Netflix</strong>, to take just one example, announced a prize worth $1 million to the first person who could sharpen its ML algorithm by increasing its accuracy by 10%. This is sureshot evidence that even a slight enhancement in ML algorithms is immensely profitable for the companies that use them, and thus, so are the people behind them. And with ML, you can be one of them!</p>\n",
