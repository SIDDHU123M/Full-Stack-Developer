However, over a period of time, this device technically advanced; at present, it can perform a wide range of desirable works apart from data processing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Major Functions of Computer System</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Following are the core functions of a computer system −</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A computer accepts the command and/or data as input given by the user.</li><li>A computer follows the instructions and stores the data given by the user.</li><li>A computer processes the data as per the instructions given by the user.</li><li>A computer gives the desirable results in the form of output.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Salient Features of Computer System</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Following are the salient features of a Computer System −</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Automation</strong>&nbsp;− The operating system of a computer system is automatic, as no human intervention is required; simply you need to give the command and then it will do the work automatically.</li><li><strong>Speed</strong>&nbsp;− Depending upon the power of the computer, it can perform, it can take Millions of instructions per second.</li><li><strong>Storage</strong>&nbsp;− A computer system can store enormous quantity of data in different format. The storage capacity of a computer system is normally expressed in terms of Kilobytes (KB), Megabytes (MB), Gigabytes (GB), or Terabytes (TB).</li><li><strong>Accuracy</strong>&nbsp;− The accuracy of a computer system is very high.</li><li><strong>Versatility</strong>&nbsp;− A computer system is capable of performing a wide range of tasks.</li><li><strong>Diligence</strong>&nbsp;− A computer neither get tired nor lose concentration.</li><li><strong>Reliability</strong>&nbsp;− As a computer system always gives accurate result; therefore, its reliability is very high.</li><li><strong>Vast memory</strong>&nbsp;− A computer system can have a wide range of memory which can recall the desired data at any point of time.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Evolution of Computer System</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The present Computer System has evolved after centuries of efforts from different intellectuals who contributed their works during different periods of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Abacus</strong>&nbsp;is (most likely) considered as the earlier counting device.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us now read about the innovators who contributed immensely in the development of a computer system.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>John Napier</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Napier was a Scottish mathematician who invented logarithms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further, Napier also invented a computing device, which consisted of sticks with numbers imprinted on them. Napier named sticks ‘bones,’ as they were made up of bones.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Blaise Pascal</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Pascal was a French mathematician who invented a machine based on gear wheels, which helped greatly in calculation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Charles Babbage</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Babbage was an English Polymath, Mathematician, Mechanical Engineer, Philosopher, and Inventor. In 1822, he developed a machine capable to calculate the successive difference of expression and prepared a table which helped him in his calculations.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Lady Ada Lovelace</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Lovelace was an English mathematician, who researched on Babbage’s work. She has given the concept that ‘computers can be programmed’. Her work helped a great deal in the advancement of computer system.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>John Atanstoff</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With the assistance of Berry, John Atanstoff developed the Atanstoff Berry Computer (more popular as ABC) in 1937. It marked the beginning of the development of electronic digital computer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>John Mauchly and Eckart</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1947, John Mauchly and Eckart developed the first large scale Electronic Digital Computer. It was called the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator (ENIAC).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Maurice V. Wilkes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1949, Wilkes (at Cambridge University) designed Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC). It was the first computer that started its operating system on the stored program concept.</p>\n",

Furthermore, the advancement of communications, electronic service networks, and multimedia have opened a new door for corporates by providing an effective way of business processing, payment transfer, and service delivery.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Advantages of Computers in Business</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Following are the major advantages of introducing computer system in business −</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Independency</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As computers help in making the business automated, the businesses are becoming more and more independent. No more, there is the need to put man-power for every work, as with the help of computer most of the works can be automated. Starting from ticket booking to a luxury car manufacturing, everything is automated.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/basics_of_computer_science/images/independency.jpg\" alt=\"Independency\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Cost Cutting</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A number of business are based online in recent times; therefore, there is no need to open business branch in every city, rather having one centralized inventory can make the business easier. There is no need to employ many man-power.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Marketing</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With the use of computer system with Internet facility, it is very simple to make a business global in a given period of time. Website, email, social media websites, online advertisements, etc. are the important tools of online marketing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/basics_of_computer_science/images/marketing.jpg\" alt=\"Marketing\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Huge Transaction Capacity</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A number of tasks are being done by computer including ticket booking to money transactions; this increases the transaction capacity.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Huge Storage Capacity</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Normally, most of the businesses need to store and maintain huge data and other records; manually, it is very difficult to maintain, but the use of computer not only increases the storage capacity, but also facilitates the processing and retrieval of data anytime.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Improvement of Productivity &amp; Efficiency</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As most of the tasks in almost every industry has become automated, it has now become much easier to manufacture a huge bulk of products in very less time. Through computer technology, services also became faster and easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>High Accuracy</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There is hardly any scope of errors in an automated system; however, if any error occurs, it is largely a human error.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ease of Data Sharing</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Data sharing has now become very simple just the way it is simple to link one computer system to another.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Competition</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The applicability of computer technology has increased competition; now, the customers can avail support 24&#215;7.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Enhanced the Security System</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Computer also helps keep the data of businesses secure. However, this security can face threats too. For instance, if someone hacks the system or there is a virus attack, it can have the potential to damage all the data that is secured.</p>\n",

This technique is suitable even for small offices.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Multiple Programming</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This technique provides facility to store and execute more than one program in the Central Processing Unit (CPU) simultaneously. Further, the multiple programming technique increases the overall working efficiency of the respective computer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Real-time Processing</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This technique facilitates the user to have direct contact with the computer system. This technique eases data processing. This technique is also known as the direct mode or the interactive mode technique and is developed exclusively to perform one task. It is a sort of online processing, which always remains under execution.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>On-line Processing</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This technique facilitates the entry and execution of data directly; so, it does not store or accumulate first and then process. The technique is developed in such a way that reduces the data entry errors, as it validates data at various points and also ensures that only corrected data is entered. This technique is widely used for online applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Time-sharing Processing</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is another form of online data processing that facilitates several users to share the resources of an online computer system. This technique is adopted when results are needed swiftly. Moreover, as the name suggests, this system is time based.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following are some of the major advantages of time-sharing processing −</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Several users can be served simultaneously</li><li>All the users have almost equal amount of processing time</li><li>There is possibility of interaction with the running programs</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Distributed Processing</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a specialized data processing technique in which various computers (which are located remotely) remain interconnected with a single host computer making a network of computer.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/basics_of_computer_science/images/distributed_processing.jpg\" alt=\"Distributed Processing\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All these computer systems remain interconnected with a high speed communication network. This facilitates in the communication between computers. However, the central computer system maintains the master data base and monitors accordingly.</p>\n",

Networking technology has revolutionized the world and created a new arena for the overall development of every nation.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/basics_of_computer_science/images/computer_networking.jpg\" alt=\"Computer Networking\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Advantages of Networking</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us now discuss the advantages of networking. The advantages are described below −</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Facility of Technical Support</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of having computer networking, a person sitting in the United States of America provides technical support to a person sitting in a remote part of India.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Easy Sharing of Data</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With the help of networking, it is very simple to share all formats of digital data from one computer system to another (irrespective of their geographic location).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Easy Sharing of Hardware Resource</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With the help of networking, it has now become very simple to share the expensive resources including storage space, processor, fax, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Easy Sharing Software</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Through the networking system, it is easy to share and install the software from one computer system to another computer system.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Easy to Decentralize Data Processing</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Through the networking system, it is very simple to decentralize the data processing system. It ultimately helps to control, secure, and manage the important data.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Easy to Communicate</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With the help of networking, the communication system has now become highly efficient, frugal, and fast. The different modes of communication are text chatting, video chatting, emails, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/basics_of_computer_science/images/easy_to_communicate.jpg\" alt=\"Easy to Communicate\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Types of Network</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In this section, we will discuss the different types of network. The types are described below −</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Local Area Network (LAN)</li><li>Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)</li><li>Wide Area Network (WAN)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Local Area Network</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Local Area Network or simply LAN is the technique of interconnecting a few computers located in a given premise. It is normally used for a single business office or a residential apartment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The major purpose of such interconnectivity is to establish a communication system in order to make the work easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, in such connectivity, some other devices can also be attached such as laser printers, fax machine, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Metropolitan Area Network</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Metropolitan Area Network or simply MAN is a system of network that normally covers a large metropolitan area (city part).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It provides high speed Internet services throughout the area covered within the network.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Wide Area Network</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Wide Area Network or simply WAN is a system of network that covers a large geographical area across the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The services of WAN are provided by public (government) agencies as well as private agencies. The network also provides the facility to access databases located remotely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WAN system is highly beneficial for MNCs and other big corporate companies (offering online services).</p>\n",

Algorithm is normally done in the form of flowcharts and pseudo codes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Verification of Algorithm</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the algorithm is developed, it cannot be applied directly rather primarily it needs to be tested specially for the accuracy. If there is any error, it is rectified and solved in the beginning itself. The verification process saves time, money, and energy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Coding</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the basic processes and steps are completed successfully, then the actual coding of a program starts in the given programming language.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Testing of Program</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing of the development of program code is another essential feature, as it is bound with errors; hence, testing makes it error free. The developer keeps testing and correcting the coding until he/she develops it finally.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Documentation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the coding and programming is done successfully, it is the job of the developer to document all these features and steps. The documented program instructs users on how to run and operate the respective program.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Implementation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the above steps are executed successfully, the developed codes (programming language) are installed in the computer system for the end users. The users are also manuals &#8211; explaining how to run the respective programs.</p>\n",

Once you delete any sort of file, it gets stored (automatically) into recycle bin; therefore, if you mistakenly deleted some important file, don’t panic, go to recycle bin and restore it. However, if you deleted file from recycle bin as well, then it is very difficult to restore that permanently deleted file.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/basics_of_computer_science/images/recycle_bin.jpg\" alt=\"Recycle Bin\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Internet Option</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The option (i.e., short-cut key) of the Internet browser may be available on the main screen or at the bottom menu bar (as shown in the image given below).

For example, TV presents audio and video; book presents text, image, and graphs, computer, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The information presented through multimedia has better quality and capability, as it can be understood easily.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/basics_of_computer_science/images/computer_multimedia.jpg\" alt=\"Computer Multimedia\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The advanced computer system is a great example of modern multimedia.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Literal Meaning of Multimedia</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In this section, we will understand the literal meaning of multimedia.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Multi</strong>&nbsp;− it means more than one</li><li><strong>Medium</strong>&nbsp;− it is singular and it means intermediary or mean</li><li><strong>Media</strong>&nbsp;− it is plural and it means conveying the information</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Likewise, Multimedia is the field of Computer Science that integrates different forms of information and represents in the form of audio, video, and animation along with the traditional media, i.e., text, graphics/drawings, images, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Multimedia Computer System</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Multimedia computer system has high capacity to integrate different media including text, image, graphics, audio, and video.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The multimedia computer system stores, represents, processes, manipulates, and makes available to users.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Significant Features of Multimedia Computer System</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Following are the major features multimedia computer system −</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Its Central Processing Unit (CPU) is very fast, as it needs to process large amount of data.</li><li>It has huge storage capacity.</li><li>It has huge memory power that helps in running heavy data programs.</li><li>It has high capacity graphic card that helps in displaying graphics, animation, video, etc.</li><li>The sound system makes it easy to listen to audio.</li><li>With all these features (discussed above), a computer system is known as high end multimedia computer system.</li><li>However, all the features listed above are not essentially required for every multimedia computer system, but rather the features of a multimedia computer system are configured as per the need of respective user.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Multimedia Components</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Following are the major components of a multimedia computer system −</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Text</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It contains alphanumeric and some other special characters. Keyboard is usually used for input of text; however, there are some internal (inbuilt) features to include such text.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Graphics</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It is technology to generate, represent, process, manipulate, and display pictures. It is one of the most important components of multimedia application. The development of graphics is supported by a different software.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Animation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Computer animation is a modern technology, which helps in creating, developing, sequencing, and displaying a set of images (technically known as ‘<em>frames</em>’). Animation gives visual effects or motion very similar to that of a video file (see image given below).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/basics_of_computer_science/images/animation.jpg\" alt=\"Animation\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Audio</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This technology records, synthesizes, and plays audio (sound). There are many learning courses and different instructions that can be delivered through this medium appropriately.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Video</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This technology records, synthesizes, and displays images (known as frames) in such sequences (at a fixed speed) that makes the creation appear as moving; this is how we see a completely developed video. In order to watch a video without any interruption, video device must display 25 to 30 frames/second.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Multimedia Application</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us now see the different fields where multimedia is applied. The fields are described in brief below −</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Presentation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With the help of multimedia, presentation can be made effective.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>E-books</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, books are digitized and easily available on the Internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Digital Library</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The need to be physically present at a library is no more necessary. Libraries can be accessed from the Internet also. Digitization has helped libraries to come to this level of development.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>E-learning</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, most of the institutions (public as well as private both) are using such technology to education people.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Movie making</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the special effects that we see in any movie, is only because of multimedia technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Video games</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Video games are one of the most interesting creations of multimedia technology. Video games fascinate not only the children but adults too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Animated films</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with video games, animated film is another great source of entertainment for children.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Multimedia conferencing</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>People can arrange personal as well as business meetings online with the help of multimedia conferencing technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>E-shopping</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Multimedia technology has created a virtual arena for the e-commerce.</p>\n",

Unlike a computer virus, it is self-contained and hence does not need to be part of another program to propagate itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Trojan Horse</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A Trojan Horse is also a sort of destructive program that remains disguised in a normal software program. It is not exactly a virus, as it cannot replicate itself. However, there is possibility that virus program may remain concealed in the Trojan Horse.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bombs</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It is similar to Trojan Horse, but Logic bombs have some specialty; these include a timing device and hence it will go off only at a particular date and time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How Does Virus Affect?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us discuss in what ways a virus can affect your computer system. The ways are mentioned below −</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>By downloading files from the Internet.</li><li>During the removable of media or drives.</li><li>Through pen drive.</li><li>Through e-mail attachments.</li><li>Through unpatched software &amp; services.</li><li>Through unprotected or poor administrator passwords.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Impact of Virus</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us now see the impact of virus on your computer system −</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Disrupts the normal functionality of respective computer system.</li><li>Disrupts system network use.</li><li>Modifies configuration setting of the system.</li><li>Destructs data.</li><li>Disrupts computer network resources.</li><li>Destructs of confidential data.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Virus Detection</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The most fundamental method of detection of virus is to check the functionality of your computer system; a virus affected computer does not take command properly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if there is antivirus software in your computer system, then it can easily check programs and files on a system for virus signatures.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Virus Preventive Measures</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us now see the different virus preventive measures. A computer system can be protected from virus through the following −</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Installation of an effective antivirus software.</li><li>Patching up the operating system.</li><li>Patching up the client software.</li><li>Putting highly secured Passwords.</li><li>Use of Firewalls.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Most Effective Antivirus</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Following are the most popular and effective antivirus from which you can choose one for your personal computer −</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>McAfee Antivirus Plus</li><li>Symantec Norton Antivirus</li><li>Avast Pro Antivirus</li><li>Bitdefender Antivirus Plus</li><li>Kaspersky Anti-Virus</li><li>Avira Antivirus</li><li>Webroot Secure Anywhere Antivirus</li><li>Emsisoft Anti-Malware</li><li>Quick Heal Antivirus</li><li>ESET NOD32 Antivirus</li></ul>\n",
