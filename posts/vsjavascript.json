different numeric types like int, fixed-point decimal, etc.</td></tr><tr><td>JavaScript uses curly brackets</td><td>Python uses indentation</td></tr><tr><td>JavaScript has fewer modules like date, math, regexp, JSON.</td><td>Python includes a wide range of modules.</td></tr><tr><td>JavaScript objects have properties that can be composed of underlying attributes which let you define a property.</td><td>In Python programming language, getter and setter functions are used to defining an attribute.</td></tr><tr><td>JavaScript uses a prototype-based inheritance model.</td><td>Python uses the class-based inheritance model.</td></tr><tr><td>In addition to front-end and back-end development, JavaScript is also a good option for mobile development.</td><td>Python is not a good fit
