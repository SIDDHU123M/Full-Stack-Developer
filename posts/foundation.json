As the files consist all things in the framework so every time you don&#8217;t need to include separate files for individual functionality. At the time of writing this tutorial, the latest version (Foundation 6) was downloaded.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>File Structure</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once Foundation is downloaded, extract the ZIP file, and you will see the following file/directory structure −</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/foundation/images/foundation-installation/filestructure.jpg\" alt=\"Foundation Installation\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see, there are compiled CSS and JS (foundation.*), as well as compiled and minified CSS and JS (foundation.min.*).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are using the CDN versions of the library throughout this tutorial.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>HTML Template</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A basic HTML template using Foundation is as shown below −</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html>\n&lt;html>\n   &lt;head>\n      &lt;title>Foundation Template&lt;/title>\n      &lt;meta name = \"viewport\" content = \"width = device-width, initial-scale = 1\">\n\n      &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/foundation-sites@6.5.1/dist/css/foundation.min.css\" integrity=\"sha256-1mcRjtAxlSjp6XJBgrBeeCORfBp/ppyX4tsvpQVCcpA= sha384-b5S5X654rX3Wo6z5/hnQ4GBmKuIJKMPwrJXn52ypjztlnDK2w9+9hSMBz/asy9Gw sha512-M1VveR2JGzpgWHb0elGqPTltHK3xbvu3Brgjfg4cg5ZNtyyApxw/45yHYsZ/rCVbfoO5MSZxB241wWq642jLtA==\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\">\n\n      &lt;!-- Compressed JavaScript -->\n      &lt;script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/foundation/6.0.1/js/vendor/jquery.min.js\">&lt;/script>\n      &lt;script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/foundation-sites@6.5.1/dist/js/foundation.min.js\" integrity=\"sha256-WUKHnLrIrx8dew//IpSEmPN/NT3DGAEmIePQYIEJLLs= sha384-53StQWuVbn6figscdDC3xV00aYCPEz3srBdV/QGSXw3f19og3Tq2wTRe0vJqRTEO sha512-X9O+2f1ty1rzBJOC8AXBnuNUdyJg0m8xMKmbt9I3Vu/UOWmSg5zG+dtnje4wAZrKtkopz/PEDClHZ1LXx5IeOw==\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\">&lt;/script>\n   &lt;/head>\n\n   &lt;body>\n      &lt;h1>Hello, world!&lt;/h1>\n   &lt;/body>\n&lt;/html></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The following sections describe the above code in detail.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>HTML5 doctype</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Foundation consists of certain HTML elements and CSS properties that require the use of the HTML5 doctype.

      "rendered": "\n<p>You can start with your project development with some available templates which can be installed through Yeti Launch or <strong>Foundation CLI</strong>. You can start with the new project by using these templates by using <em>Gulp</em> build system for the processing of the Sass, JavaScript, copying files etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Basic Template</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The basic template is something like SASS template, which includes the flat directory structure and compiles only SASS files and it is good to have this simple template while using only SASS. You can use the basic template by using Yeti Launch or using Foundation CLI using the following command −</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>$ foundation new --framework sites --template basic</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>To set up this, first run the <em>npm install</em>, <em>bower install</em> and use the <em>npm start</em> command to run it. You can also download the template files from the Github.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>ZURB Template</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a combination of CSS/SCSS, JavaScript, Handlebars template, markup structure, image compression and uses SASS processing. You can use the ZURB template by using&nbsp;<em>Yeti Launch</em>&nbsp;or using&nbsp;<em>Foundation CLI</em>&nbsp;using the below command −</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>$ foundation new --framework sites --template zurb\n</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>To run this template, follow the same steps specified in the basic template. You can also download the template files from the&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://github.com/zurb/foundation-zurb-template/archive/master.zip\">Github</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Asset Copying</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can copy the content in the&nbsp;<em>src/assets</em>&nbsp;folder using&nbsp;<em>Gulp</em>&nbsp;in which&nbsp;<em>assets</em>&nbsp;will be your project folder. Important thing here is, the SASS files, JavaScript files and images will not come under this asset copying process, as they will be having their own process to copy the content.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Page Compilation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can create HTML pages under three folders namely <em>pages</em>, <em>layouts</em> and <em>partials</em> which resides inside the <em>src/</em> directory. You can use the Panini flat file compiler that creates layouts for pages by using templates, pages, HTML partials. This process can be done by using Handlebars templating language.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>SASS Compilation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can compile the SASS to CSS using Libsass and the main SASS file will be stored under <em>src/assets/scss/app.scss</em> and also newly created SASS partials will be stored under this folder itself. The output of CSS will be like normal CSS, which is in the nested style. You can compress the CSS with clean-css and removes the unused CSS from the stylesheet using UnCSS.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>JavaScript Compilation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The JavaScript files will be stored under&nbsp;<em>src/assets/js</em>&nbsp;folder along with Foundation and all dependencies are tied together into&nbsp;<em>app.js</em>&nbsp;file. The files will be tied together as specified in the below order −</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Dependencies of Foundation.</li><li>Files will be stored under&nbsp;<em>src/assets/js</em>&nbsp;folder.</li><li>The files are bundled into one file called&nbsp;<em>app.js</em>.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Image Compression</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By default, all images will be stored under&nbsp;<em>assets/img</em>&nbsp;folder under&nbsp;<em>dist</em>&nbsp;folder. You can compress the images while building for production using&nbsp;<em>gulp-imagemin</em>&nbsp;which supports JPEG, PNG, SVG and GIF files.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>BrowserSync</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can create a&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.browsersync.io/\">BrowserSync</a>&nbsp;server which is synchronized browser testing available at&nbsp;<strong>http://localhost:8000</strong>&nbsp;and able to see the compiled templates using this URL. While your server is running, the page refreshes automatically when you save the file and you could see the changes made to the page in real time as you work.</p>\n",

Following is the command to load the framework −</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>npm install foundation-sites --save</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>After running the above command line code, you will get the following lines −</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/foundation/images/foundation-sass/foundation-sass-cli.jpg\" alt=\"Foundation sass\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Compiling Manually</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Framework files can be added as an import path depending upon on your build process, but the path will be the same&nbsp;<em>packages_folder/foundation-sites/scss</em>. The&nbsp;<em>@import</em>&nbsp;statement is included at the top of the&nbsp;<em>foundation-sites.scss</em>&nbsp;file. The next line in the given code is explained in the&nbsp;<strong>Adjusting CSS Output</strong>&nbsp;section.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>@import 'foundation';\n@include foundation-everything;\n</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h3>Using Compiled CSS</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can include the pre-compiled CSS files. There are two types of CSS files, i.e. minified and unminified. Minified version is used for production and the unminified version is used to directly edit the framework CSS.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;link rel = \"stylesheet\" href = \"node_modules/foundation-sites/dist/foundation-sites.css\">\n&lt;link rel = \"stylesheet\" href = \"node_modules/foundation-sites/dist/foundation-sites.min.css\"></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h2>Adjusting CSS Output</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For various components, Foundation output consist of many classes. It is used to control the CSS output of the framework. Add the following single line of code to include all the components at once.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>@include foundation-everything;\n</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The following is the list of the components imported when you write the above code in your scss file. The components which are not necessary can be commented. You can view the below given code lines in the&nbsp;<em>Your_folder_name/node_modules/foundation-sites/scss/foundation.scss</em>&nbsp;file.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>@import 'foundation';\n\n@import 'grid/grid';\n@import 'typography/typography';\n@import 'forms/forms';\n@import 'components/visibility';\n@import 'components/float';\n@import 'components/button';\n@import 'components/button-group';\n@import 'components/accordion-menu';\n@import 'components/accordion';\n@import 'components/badge';\n@import 'components/breadcrumbs';\n@import 'components/callout';\n@import 'components/close-button';\n@import 'components/drilldown';\n...\n...\n...\n//so on....</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Settings File</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A settings file is included in the entire foundation project i.e.&nbsp;<em>_settings.scss</em>. If you are using Yeti Launch or the CLI to create a Foundation for Sites project, you can find the settings file under src/assets/scss/.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have installed Foundation using npm, hence you can find the settings file included under&nbsp;<em>your_folder_name/node_modules/foundation-sites/scss/settings/_settings.scss</em>. You can move this into your own Sass files to work with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can write your own CSS, if you are not able to customize with variables. Following is a set of variables, which change the default styling of buttons.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>$button-padding: 0.85em 1em;\n$button-margin: 0 $global-margin $global-margin 0;\n$button-fill: solid;\n$button-background: $primary-color;\n$button-background-hover: scale-color($button-background, $lightness: -15%);\n$button-color: #fff;\n$button-color-alt: #000;\n$button-radius: $global-radius;\n\n$button-sizes: (\n   tiny: 0.6rem,\n   small: 0.75rem,\n   default: 0.9rem,\n   large: 1.25rem,\n);\n$button-opacity-disabled: 0.25;</code></pre>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "\n<p>In this chapter, we will study about&nbsp;<em>JavaScript</em>. It is easy to set up JavaScript in Foundation; only thing you require is jQuery.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>JavaScript Installing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use ZIP download, package manager, or CDN to get Foundation JavaScript file. In your code you can provide links to jQuery and Foundation as &lt;script&gt; tags, placed before the closing &lt;body&gt; and check that Foundation is loaded after jQuery. For more information&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/foundation/foundation_javascript_installation.htm\">click here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>File Structure</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you install Foundation through command line, Foundation plugins downloads as individual files such as&nbsp;<em>foundation.tabs.js</em>,&nbsp;<em>foundation.dropdownMenu.js</em>,&nbsp;<em>foundation.slider.js</em>&nbsp;and so on. All these files are combined into&nbsp;<em>foundation.js</em>, which provides all the plugins at one time. If you wish to use some plugin, first&nbsp;<em>foundation.core.js</em>&nbsp;should be loaded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance −</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;script src = \"js/jquery.min.js\">&lt;/script>\n&lt;script src = \"js/foundation.core.js\">&lt;/script>\n&lt;script src = \"js/foundation.tabs.js\">&lt;/script>\n</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Certain plugins may require particular utility libraries, which come with Foundation installation. You can study in detail about specific plugin requirements in the next chapter&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/foundation/foundation_javascript_utilities.htm\">JavaScript Utilities</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Loading individual files creates network overhead, specifically for mobile users. For faster page loading, use of&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://gruntjs.com/\">grunt</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://gulpjs.com/\">gulp</a>&nbsp;is recommended.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Initializing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The&nbsp;<em>foundation()</em>&nbsp;function is used to initialize all the Foundation plugin at one time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance −</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>(document).foundation();</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h2>Using Plugins</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Using data attributes, plugins are connected to HTML elements as they match the plugins’ name. A single HTML element can have only one plugin at a time, although the majority of the plugins can be nested within other ones. For instance, tooltip link is created by adding&nbsp;<em>data-tooltip</em>. For more information&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/foundation/javascript_using_plugins.htm\">click here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Configuring Plugins</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Plugins can be customized by using its configuration settings. For instance, you can set the speed of the&nbsp;<em>accordion</em>&nbsp;slides up and down. The plugin settings can be globally changed using the plugin&#8217;s&nbsp;<strong>DEFAULTS</strong>&nbsp;property. For more information&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/foundation/javascript_configuring_plugins.htm\">click here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Adding Plugins after Page Load</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When new HTML is added to the DOM, any of the plugins on those elements will not be initialized by default. You can check for new plugins by re-calling the&nbsp;<em>.foundation()</em>&nbsp;function.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance −</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>$.ajax('assets/partials/kitten-carousel.html', function(data) {\n   $('#kitten-carousel'&lt;/span>).html(data).foundation();\n});</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h2>Programmatic Use</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In JavaScript, plugins can be created programmatically and each plugin is global&nbsp;<em>Foundation</em>&nbsp;object&#8217;s class, with a constructor which takes two parameters such as an element and an object.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>var $accordion = new Foundation.Accordion($('#accordion'), {\n   slideSpeed: 600, multiExpand: true\n});</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Majority of the plugins are provided with public API, which lets you manipulate it via JavaScript. You can look through the documentations of plugin to study the available functions and methods can be invoked easily.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance −</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>$('.tooltip').foundation('destroy'); \n// this will destroy all Tooltips on the page.\t\n\n$('#reveal').foundation('open'); \n// this will open a Reveal modal with id `reveal`.\n\n$('&#91;data-tabs]').eq(0).foundation('selectTab', $('#example')); \n// this will change the first Tabs on the page to whatever panel you choose.</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>You are allowed to choose any jQuery selector and if the selector holds multiple plugins, then they all will have identical chosen method called.</li><li>Arguments can be passed just like passing arguments to JavaScript.</li><li>Methods that are prefixed with&nbsp;<em>underscore(_)</em>&nbsp;are considered as a portion of internal API, meaning, that without warning they can break, change or even disappear.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Events</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever a specific function finishes, DOM triggers an event. For instance, whenever tabs are changed, it can be listened and create a return response to it. Each plugin can trigger list of events, which will be documented in plugin&#8217;s documentation. In Foundation 6, callback plugins are removed and must be taken as event listeners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance −</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>$('&#91;data-tabs]').on('change.zf.tabs', function() {\n   console.log('Tabs are changed!');\n});</code></pre>\n",
