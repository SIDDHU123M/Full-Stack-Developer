It is a javascript library that uses observables to work with reactive programming that deals with asynchronous data calls, callbacks and event-based programs. RxJS can be used with other Javascript libraries and frameworks. It is supported by javascript and also with typescript.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is RxJS?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As per the official website of&nbsp;RxJS, it is defined as a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences. It provides one core type, the Observable, satellite types (Observer, Schedulers, Subjects) and operators inspired by Array#extras (map, filter, reduce, every, etc.) to allow handling asynchronous events as collections.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Features of RxJS</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In RxJS, the following concepts takes care of handling the async task −</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Observable</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An observable is a function that creates an observer and attaches it to the source where values are expected, for example, clicks, mouse events from a dom element or an Http request, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Observer</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It is an object with next(), error() and complete() methods, that will get called when there is interaction to the with the observable i.e. the source interacts for an example button click, Http request, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Subscription</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When the observable is created, to execute the observable we need to subscribe to it. It can also be used to cancel the execution.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Operators</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An operator is a pure function that takes in observable as input and the output is also an observable.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Subject</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A subject is an observable that can multicast i.e. talk to many observers. Consider a button with an event listener, the function attached to the event using addlistener is called every time the user clicks on the button similar functionality goes for subject too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Schedulers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A scheduler controls the execution of when the subscription has to start and notified.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When to use RxJS?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If your project consists of lots of async task handling than RxJS is a good choice. It is loaded by default with the Angular project.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Advantages of using RxJS</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The following are the advantages of using RxJS −</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>RxJS can be used with other Javascript libraries and frameworks.

To work with RxJS, we need the following setup −</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>NodeJS</li><li>Npm</li><li>RxJS package installation</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>NODEJS and NPM Installation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is very easy to install RxJS using npm. You need to have nodejs and npm installed on your system. To verify if NodeJS and npm is installed on your system, try to execute the following command in your command prompt.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>E:\\>node -v &amp;&amp; npm -v\nv10.15.1\n6.4.1\n﻿</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>In case you are getting the version, it means nodejs and npm is installed on your system and the version is 10 and 6 right now on the system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it does not print anything, install nodejs on your system. To install nodejs, go to the homepage&nbsp;https://nodejs.org/en/download/&nbsp;of nodejs and install the package based on your OS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The download page of nodejs will look like the following −</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/rxjs/images/nodejs.jpg\" alt=\"NodeJS\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on your OS, install the required package. Once nodejs is installed, npm will also be installed along with it. To check if npm is installed or not, type npm –v in the terminal. It should display the version of the npm.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>RxJS Package Installation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To start with RxJS installation, first create a folder called&nbsp;<strong>rxjsproj/</strong>&nbsp;where we will practice all RxJS examples.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the folder&nbsp;<strong>rxjsproj/</strong>&nbsp;is created, run command&nbsp;<strong>npm init</strong>, for project setup as shown below</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>E:\\>mkdir rxjsproj\nE:\\>cd rxjsproj\nE:\\rxjsproj>npm init</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Npm init</strong>&nbsp;command will ask few questions during execution, just press enter and proceed. Once the execution of npm init is done, it will create&nbsp;<strong>package.json</strong>&nbsp;inside rxjsproj/ as shown below −</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>rxjsproj/\n   package.json</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you can install rxjs using below command −</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>npm install ---save-dev rxjs</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>E:\\rxjsproj>npm install --save-dev rxjs\nnpm notice created a lockfile as package-lock.json.

Anytime you subscribe to the observable the execution will start from scratch. Take an Http call made using ajax, and 2 subscribers calling the observable. You will see 2 HttpHttp requests in the browser network tab.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is a working example of same −</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>import { ajax } from 'rxjs/ajax';\nimport { map } from 'rxjs/operators';\n\nlet final_val = ajax('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users').pipe(map(e => e.response));\nlet subscriber1 = final_val.subscribe(a => console.log(a));\nlet subscriber2 = final_val.subscribe(a => console.log(a));</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/rxjs/images/observable.jpg\" alt=\"Observable\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/rxjs/images/observable_ex.jpg\" alt=\"Observable Ex\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, here the problem is, we want the same data to be shared, but not, at the cost of 2 Http calls. We want to make one Http call and share the data between subscribers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will be possible using Subjects. It is an observable that can multicast i.e. talk to many observers. It can share the value between subscribers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is a working example using Subjects −</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>import { Subject } from 'rxjs';\nimport { ajax } from 'rxjs/ajax';\nimport { map } from 'rxjs/operators';\n\nconst subject_test = new Subject();\n\nsubject_test.subscribe({\n   next: (v) => console.log(v)\n});\nsubject_test.subscribe({\n   next: (v) => console.log(v)\n});\n\nlet final_val = ajax('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users').pipe(map(e => e.response));\nlet subscriber = final_val.subscribe(subject_test);</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/rxjs/images/observable_possible.jpg\" alt=\"Observable possible\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you can see only one Http call and the same data is shared between the subscribers called.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/rxjs/images/observable_subscribers.jpg\" alt=\"Observable subscribers\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Behaviour Subject</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Behaviour subject will give you the latest value when called.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can create behaviour subject as shown below −</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>import { BehaviorSubject } from 'rxjs';\nconst subject = new BehaviorSubject(\"Testing Behaviour Subject\"); \n// initialized the behaviour subject with value:Testing Behaviour Subject</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is a working example to use Behaviour Subject −</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>import { BehaviorSubject } from 'rxjs';\nconst behavior_subject = new BehaviorSubject(\"Testing Behaviour Subject\"); \n// 0 is the initial value\n\nbehavior_subject.subscribe({\n   next: (v) => console.log(`observerA: ${v}`)\n});\n\nbehavior_subject.next(\"Hello\");\nbehavior_subject.subscribe({\n   next: (v) => console.log(`observerB: ${v}`)\n});\nbehavior_subject.next(\"Last call to Behaviour Subject\");</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/rxjs/images/behaviour_subject.jpg\" alt=\"Behaviour Subject\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Replay Subject</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A replaysubject is similar to behaviour subject, wherein, it can buffer the values and replay the same to the new subscribers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is a working example of replay subject −</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>import { ReplaySubject } from 'rxjs';\nconst replay_subject = new ReplaySubject(2); \n// buffer 2 values but new subscribers\n\nreplay_subject.subscribe({\n   next: (v) => console.log(`Testing Replay Subject A: ${v}`)\n});\n\nreplay_subject.next(1);\nreplay_subject.next(2);\nreplay_subject.next(3);\nreplay_subject.subscribe({\n   next: (v) => console.log(`Testing Replay Subject B: ${v}`)\n});\n\nreplay_subject.next(5);</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The buffer value used is 2 on the replay subject.
