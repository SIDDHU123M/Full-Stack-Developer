# Python Collections

In Python, collections are used to store and manipulate groups of related data. There are several built-in collection types available in Python, including lists, sets, tuples, and dictionaries. Each collection type has its own unique characteristics and use cases.

## Lists

A list is an ordered collection of items that can be of any data type. Lists are mutable, which means you can modify their elements. Here's an example of creating a list:

```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']
```

## Sets

A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are useful when you want to store a collection of items without any duplicates. Here's an example of creating a set:

```python
colors = {'red', 'green', 'blue'}
```

## Tuples

A tuple is an ordered collection of elements, similar to a list. However, tuples are immutable, which means you cannot modify their elements once they are defined. Here's an example of creating a tuple:

```python
point = (3, 4)
```

## Dictionaries

A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Each key in a dictionary is unique, and it is used to access its corresponding value. Dictionaries are useful when you want to store data in a structured manner. Here's an example of creating a dictionary:

```python
person = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
```

These are just the basic concepts of Python collections. Each collection type has its own set of methods and operations that you can perform on them. It's important to understand the characteristics and use cases of each collection type to effectively work with data in Python.

For more information and detailed examples, you can refer to the official Python documentation on collections: [Python Collections Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html)
