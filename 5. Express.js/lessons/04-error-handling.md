# Error Handling

In Express.js, error handling is an important aspect of building robust and reliable applications. Proper error handling ensures that your application can gracefully handle unexpected errors and provide meaningful responses to clients.

## Middleware Error Handling

Express.js provides a built-in mechanism for handling errors using middleware. You can define error-handling middleware functions that have four parameters: `err`, `req`, `res`, and `next`. These middleware functions are executed when an error occurs during the processing of a request.

Here's an example of an error-handling middleware function:

```javascript
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  // Handle the error
  console.error(err);

  // Send an error response to the client
  res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal Server Error' });
});
```

In this example, the error-handling middleware function logs the error to the console and sends a JSON response with a 500 status code to the client.

## Error Handling Best Practices

When handling errors in Express.js, it's important to follow some best practices:

1. Use specific error-handling middleware functions for different types of errors. For example, you can have separate middleware functions for handling validation errors, database errors, and server errors.

2. Use the `next` function to pass the error to the next error-handling middleware function. This allows you to chain multiple error-handling middleware functions and handle errors at different levels of your application.

3. Use proper error status codes in your responses. For example, use 400 for client errors (e.g., validation errors) and 500 for server errors.

4. Provide meaningful error messages to clients. This helps them understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

5. Implement centralized error handling for unhandled errors. You can use the `process.on('uncaughtException')` event to catch unhandled exceptions and log them.

## Exercise

1. Create a new Express.js application.
2. Implement error-handling middleware functions for handling different types of errors.
3. Test your error handling by intentionally triggering different types of errors and verifying that the correct error responses are sent to the client.

## Conclusion

Proper error handling is crucial for building reliable Express.js applications. By using error-handling middleware functions and following best practices, you can ensure that your application can handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful responses to clients.
