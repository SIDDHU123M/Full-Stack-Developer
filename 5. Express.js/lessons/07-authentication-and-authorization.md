# Authentication and Authorization

In this lesson, we will explore the concepts of authentication and authorization in Express.js. Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, while authorization determines what actions a user is allowed to perform.

## Topics Covered

- Introduction to authentication and authorization
- Different authentication strategies (e.g., JWT, Passport.js)
- User registration and login
- Role-based access control

## Lesson Structure

1. Overview of authentication and authorization
   - Explanation of the difference between authentication and authorization
   - Importance of implementing secure authentication and authorization mechanisms

2. Authentication strategies
   - Introduction to JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
   - Overview of Passport.js and its authentication strategies

3. User registration and login
   - Implementing user registration functionality
   - Creating login routes and handling user authentication

4. Role-based access control
   - Understanding the concept of roles and permissions
   - Implementing role-based access control using middleware

## Code Examples

The following code examples are provided to demonstrate the concepts covered in this lesson:

- `code-examples/07-authentication-and-authorization.js`: Complete example of implementing authentication and authorization using JWT and Passport.js. Includes comments explaining each part.

## Exercises

To reinforce your understanding of authentication and authorization in Express.js, try the following exercises:

1. Implement a user registration form and store user information in a database.
2. Create a login form and authenticate users using JWT or Passport.js.
3. Implement role-based access control for certain routes in your application.

Take your time to understand each concept and complete the exercises. Feel free to refer to the code examples for guidance.

## Conclusion

Authentication and authorization are crucial aspects of building secure web applications. By implementing proper authentication and authorization mechanisms, you can ensure that only authorized users can access certain resources and perform specific actions.

In the next lesson, we will explore the topic of deployment and learn how to deploy our Express.js application to a production environment.
