# Authentication

In this lesson, we will explore authentication in Express.js applications. Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or client accessing your application. We will cover different authentication methods and implement JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for stateless authentication.

## Topics Covered
- Overview of authentication methods
- Session-based authentication
- Token-based authentication
- Implementing JWT for stateless authentication

## Practical Example: Securing API Endpoints with JWT

In this practical example, we will secure our API endpoints using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). We will create middleware to verify the JWT token and protect our routes. This will ensure that only authenticated users can access certain parts of our application.

```javascript
// Middleware to verify JWT token
const verifyToken = (req, res, next) => {
  const token = req.headers.authorization;

  if (!token) {
    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'No token provided' });
  }

  jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET, (err, decoded) => {
    if (err) {
      return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Failed to authenticate token' });
    }

    req.user = decoded;
    next();
  });
};

// Protected route
app.get('/api/protected', verifyToken, (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Protected route accessed successfully' });
});
```

## Exercise: User Registration and Login

For the exercise, you will implement user registration and login functionality in your Express.js application. Users should be able to create an account, log in with their credentials, and access protected routes. You can use a database to store user information and bcrypt to hash passwords for secure storage.

## Conclusion

Authentication is a crucial aspect of web applications to ensure that only authorized users can access certain resources. By implementing authentication in your Express.js applications, you can protect sensitive data and provide a secure user experience.
