# Error Handling in Express.js

In Express.js, error handling is an important aspect of building robust applications. Proper error handling ensures that your application can gracefully handle and respond to errors, improving the user experience and preventing potential security vulnerabilities.

## Custom Error Handling Middleware

Express.js provides a way to handle errors using custom middleware. This allows you to centralize your error handling logic and provide consistent error responses.

To create custom error handling middleware, you can define a middleware function with four parameters: `err`, `req`, `res`, and `next`. The `err` parameter represents the error object, and `next` is a function to pass control to the next middleware.

Here's an example of custom error handling middleware:

```javascript
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  // Handle the error
  console.error(err);

  // Set the response status code
  res.status(500);

  // Send an error response
  res.json({ error: 'Internal Server Error' });
});
```

In this example, any errors that occur in the application will be caught by this middleware, and an appropriate error response will be sent to the client.

## Practical Example: Centralized Error Handling

Let's see a practical example of implementing centralized error handling in an Express application.

```javascript
// Import required modules
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Define routes
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  throw new Error('Something went wrong');
});

// Error handling middleware
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  // Handle the error
  console.error(err);

  // Set the response status code
  res.status(500);

  // Send an error response
  res.json({ error: 'Internal Server Error' });
});

// Start the server
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

In this example, when a GET request is made to the root route, an error is intentionally thrown. The custom error handling middleware catches the error, logs it, sets the response status code to 500, and sends an error response to the client.

## Exercise: Implement Error Handling in a REST API

Your task is to implement error handling in a REST API. Create a new route that intentionally throws an error, and use custom error handling middleware to handle the error and send an appropriate response to the client.

```
// Your code here
```

Remember to test your implementation and ensure that the error is handled correctly.
