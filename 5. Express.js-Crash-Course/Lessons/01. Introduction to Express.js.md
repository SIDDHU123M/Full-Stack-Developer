# Introduction to Express.js

Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building robust and scalable web applications. It provides a minimalistic and flexible approach to web development, allowing developers to create APIs, web servers, and full-stack applications with ease.

## Benefits of Express.js

- **Simplicity**: Express.js has a simple and intuitive API, making it easy to learn and use.
- **Middleware**: Express.js provides a middleware layer that allows developers to add functionality to their applications, such as logging, authentication, and error handling.
- **Routing**: Express.js has a powerful routing system that enables developers to define routes and handle HTTP requests easily.
- **Extensibility**: Express.js is highly extensible, allowing developers to integrate with various databases, templating engines, and other third-party libraries.
- **Performance**: Express.js is known for its excellent performance and scalability, making it suitable for building high-performance web applications.

## Setting up an Express Application

To get started with Express.js, you need to install it as a dependency in your Node.js project. Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory. Run the following command to install Express.js:

```bash
npm install express
```

Once installed, you can create an Express application by creating a new JavaScript file, such as `app.js`, and importing the Express module:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
```

## Creating a Basic Express Server

To create a basic Express server, you can define a route handler for the root URL ("/") and start the server to listen on a specific port. Here's an example:

```javascript
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, Express!');
});

const port = 3000;
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});
```

In this example, we define a route handler for the root URL ("/") using the `app.get()` method. When a GET request is made to the root URL, the callback function is executed, and the response "Hello, Express!" is sent back to the client.

To start the server, we use the `app.listen()` method and specify the port number (in this case, 3000). The server will listen on that port, and the callback function will be executed once the server is running.

## Exercise: Build a Static File Server

Your exercise is to extend the basic Express server to serve static files. Create a new directory called "public" in your project directory and add some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to it. Then, modify the Express server to serve these static files when requested.

Hint: Use the `express.static()` middleware to serve static files. You can specify the path to the "public" directory as an argument to the `express.static()` function.

Once you've completed the exercise, you should be able to access your static files by visiting the appropriate URLs in your browser.

Good luck!
