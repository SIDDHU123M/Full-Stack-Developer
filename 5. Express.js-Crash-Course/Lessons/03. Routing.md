# Routing in Express.js

Routing is an essential part of building web applications with Express.js. It allows you to define different routes for handling different HTTP requests. In this lesson, we will explore the concepts of routing in Express and learn how to create routes and handle requests.

## Creating Routes

In Express, routes are defined using the `app` object, which represents the Express application. You can create routes for different HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. Here's an example of creating a route for handling GET requests:

```javascript
app.get('/users', (req, res) => {
  // Handle GET request for /users route
  res.send('Get all users');
});
```

## Handling Requests

When a request matches a defined route, Express invokes the corresponding route handler function. The route handler function takes two parameters: `req` (request) and `res` (response). You can use these parameters to access the request data and send a response back to the client. Here's an example of handling a POST request:

```javascript
app.post('/users', (req, res) => {
  // Handle POST request for /users route
  const { name, email } = req.body;
  // Save user to the database
  res.send('User created successfully');
});
```

## Route Parameters

Route parameters allow you to capture dynamic values from the URL. You can define route parameters by prefixing a colon (`:`) before the parameter name. The captured values can be accessed through the `req.params` object. Here's an example of a route with a parameter:

```javascript
app.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  // Handle GET request for /users/:id route
  const userId = req.params.id;
  // Fetch user from the database using userId
  res.send(`User with ID ${userId}`);
});
```

## Query Strings

Query strings are used to pass additional data in the URL. They are appended to the URL after a question mark (`?`) and consist of key-value pairs separated by ampersands (`&`). You can access query string parameters using the `req.query` object. Here's an example of a route with query string parameters:

```javascript
app.get('/search', (req, res) => {
  // Handle GET request for /search route
  const { q, category } = req.query;
  // Perform search based on query and category
  res.send(`Search results for query: ${q}, category: ${category}`);
});
```

## Practical Example

Let's create a practical example to demonstrate routing in Express. We will build a simple blog application with routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting blog posts. You can find the code example in the file `Code Examples/03 Routing.js`.

## Exercise

Your exercise is to create an Express application with different route handlers. Implement routes for a todo application with the following functionality:
- Get all todos
- Get a specific todo by ID
- Create a new todo
- Update an existing todo
- Delete a todo

Feel free to refer to the code example in `Code Examples/03 Routing.js` for guidance.

That's it for the lesson on routing in Express.js. In the next lesson, we will explore templating engines and how to integrate them into Express.
