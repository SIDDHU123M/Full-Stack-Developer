# Templating in Express.js

In Express.js, templating engines are used to generate dynamic HTML pages by combining static HTML templates with data. Templating engines provide a way to separate the presentation logic from the application logic.

## Popular Templating Engines

There are several popular templating engines available for Express.js, including:

- **Pug (formerly Jade)**: A high-performance template engine with a concise syntax.
- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript)**: A simple and flexible template engine that uses JavaScript for dynamic content.

## Integrating Templating Engines in Express.js

To use a templating engine in Express.js, you need to install the engine as a dependency and configure Express to use it. Here's an example of integrating the Pug templating engine:

1. Install the Pug package:

   ```bash
   npm install pug
   ```

2. Set the view engine in your Express application:

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();

   app.set('view engine', 'pug');
   ```

3. Create a Pug template file (`views/index.pug`):

   ```pug
   html
     head
       title My Express App
     body
       h1 Welcome to My Express App
       p #{message}
   ```

4. Render the template in a route handler:

   ```javascript
   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
     res.render('index', { message: 'Hello, World!' });
   });
   ```

In this example, when a user visits the root URL, the `index.pug` template is rendered with the provided data.

## Exercise: Create a Simple Blog

Now it's your turn to practice using a templating engine in Express.js. Your task is to create a simple blog using a templating engine of your choice (Pug or EJS). The blog should have the following features:

- Display a list of blog posts on the homepage.
- Show individual blog posts when a user clicks on a post.
- Allow users to create new blog posts.
- Implement basic styling using CSS.

Feel free to explore the documentation of your chosen templating engine for more advanced features and customization options.

Good luck!
