# TypeScript Crash Course

This repository contains a comprehensive crash course on TypeScript, covering all essential and advanced topics relevant for full-stack development.

## Lessons

- [01_Introduction_to_TypeScript.md](Lessons/01_Introduction_to_TypeScript.md): This lesson provides an introduction to TypeScript, including its overview, benefits over JavaScript, and instructions for setting up the development environment. It covers basic syntax, such as variables, data types, and type annotations. It also includes practical examples and exercises to reinforce learning.

- [02_Functions_and_Interfaces.md](Lessons/02_Functions_and_Interfaces.md): This lesson explains functions in TypeScript, including function declarations, expressions, and type annotations for parameters and return types. It covers optional and default parameters. It also introduces interfaces, their definition, implementation in classes, and extension. It includes practical examples and exercises.

- [03_Classes_and_Inheritance.md](Lessons/03_Classes_and_Inheritance.md): This lesson covers working with classes in TypeScript, including class syntax, constructors, access modifiers (public, private, protected), and static properties/methods. It explains inheritance, extending classes, and method overriding. It also covers abstract classes and interfaces for class contracts. It includes practical examples and exercises.

- [04_Generics.md](Lessons/04_Generics.md): This lesson explains generics in TypeScript, including their advantages for type safety and reusability. It covers creating generic functions and classes and using constraints to limit types. It includes practical examples and exercises.

- [05_Modules_and_Namespaces.md](Lessons/05_Modules_and_Namespaces.md): This lesson covers working with modules in TypeScript and ES6. It explains importing and exporting modules, default vs. named exports, and the concept of namespaces. It includes practical examples and exercises.

- [06_Advanced_Types.md](Lessons/06_Advanced_Types.md): This lesson covers advanced types in TypeScript, including intersection types, union types, type guards, type aliases, mapped types, and conditional types. It includes practical examples and exercises.

- [07_Asynchronous_Programming.md](Lessons/07_Asynchronous_Programming.md): This lesson explains asynchronous programming in TypeScript using Promises and Async/Await. It covers handling asynchronous operations, type safety, and error handling. It includes practical examples and exercises.

- [08_Integrating_with_JavaScript.md](Lessons/08_Integrating_with_JavaScript.md): This lesson explains how to integrate TypeScript with existing JavaScript libraries and frameworks. It covers working with JavaScript declaration files (`.d.ts`) for type checking. It includes practical examples and exercises.

- [09_TypeScript_in_Full_Stack.md](Lessons/09_TypeScript_in_Full_Stack.md): This lesson explains the role of TypeScript in full-stack development. It covers using TypeScript with Node.js and Express for server-side applications and building full-stack applications using TypeScript for both frontend and backend. It includes practical examples and exercises.

- [10_Best_Practices_and_Testing.md](Lessons/10_Best_Practices_and_Testing.md): This lesson covers best practices for TypeScript, including coding standards, style guides, and performance optimization techniques. It also covers testing in TypeScript using testing frameworks like Jest or Mocha. It includes practical examples and exercises.
