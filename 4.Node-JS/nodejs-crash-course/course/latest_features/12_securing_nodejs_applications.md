## Introduction
Securing your Node.js applications is crucial to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access. In this section, we will cover essential security practices and techniques to ensure the safety of your application.

## Input Validation
Input validation is a critical step in preventing security vulnerabilities. By validating user input, you can protect your application from common attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection. We will explore various techniques and libraries for input validation.

## Preventing SQL Injection
SQL injection is a widespread security vulnerability that can lead to unauthorized access to your database. We will discuss how to prevent SQL injection attacks by using parameterized queries and prepared statements.

## Using Security Middleware
Security middleware can help protect your Node.js application by adding additional layers of security. We will explore popular security middleware like `helmet.js` and discuss how to configure and use them in your application.

## Authentication and Authorization
Implementing proper authentication and authorization is crucial for securing your application's resources. We will cover different authentication methods, including JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and OAuth2. We will also discuss best practices for implementing authorization and protecting sensitive routes.

## Securing APIs
Securing APIs is essential to prevent unauthorized access and protect sensitive data. We will explore techniques like rate limiting, data validation, and sanitization to ensure the security of your API endpoints. We will also discuss how to implement secure communication using HTTPS.
