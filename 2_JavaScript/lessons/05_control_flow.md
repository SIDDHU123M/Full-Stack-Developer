# Control Flow

## Introduction

Control flow refers to the order in which statements are executed in a program. JavaScript provides several control flow statements that allow you to make decisions and repeat blocks of code based on certain conditions.

## Conditional Statements

Conditional statements allow you to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. The most common conditional statements in JavaScript are:

- `if` statement
- `if...else` statement
- `else if` statement
- `switch` statement

### `if` Statement

The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true. Here's the syntax:

```javascript
if (condition) {
  // code to be executed if the condition is true
}
```

### `if...else` Statement

The `if...else` statement is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true, and another block of code if the condition is false. Here's the syntax:

```javascript
if (condition) {
  // code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
  // code to be executed if the condition is false
}
```

### `else if` Statement

The `else if` statement is used to specify a new condition if the previous condition in an `if...else` statement is false. You can have multiple `else if` statements. Here's the syntax:

```javascript
if (condition1) {
  // code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // code to be executed if condition2 is true
} else if (condition3) {
  // code to be executed if condition3 is true
} else {
  // code to be executed if all conditions are false
}
```

### `switch` Statement

The `switch` statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions. It evaluates an expression and executes the code associated with the matching case. Here's the syntax:

```javascript
switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // code to be executed if expression matches value1
    break;
  case value2:
    // code to be executed if expression matches value2
    break;
  case value3:
    // code to be executed if expression matches value3
    break;
  default:
    // code to be executed if expression doesn't match any value
}
```

## Looping Statements

Looping statements allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times. The most common looping statements in JavaScript are:

- `for` loop
- `while` loop
- `do...while` loop

### `for` Loop

The `for` loop is used to repeat a block of code a specified number of times. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement. Here's the syntax:

```javascript
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
  // code to be executed in each iteration
}
```

### `while` Loop

The `while` loop is used to repeat a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. Here's the syntax:

```javascript
while (condition) {
  // code to be executed in each iteration
}
```

### `do...while` Loop

The `do...while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but it executes the code block at least once before checking the condition. Here's the syntax:

```javascript
do {
  // code to be executed in each iteration
} while (condition);
```

## Conclusion

Control flow statements are essential for writing dynamic and interactive JavaScript programs. They allow you to make decisions and repeat code based on certain conditions, giving you more control over the flow of your program.
