# Objects and Arrays

## Objects

An object is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is a unique identifier and each value is the data associated with that key. Objects are used to represent complex data structures and can contain various data types, including other objects, arrays, and functions.

### Creating an Object

Objects can be created using object literal notation or the `Object` constructor.

```javascript
// Object literal notation
const person = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  age: 30,
  address: {
    street: '123 Main St',
    city: 'New York',
    state: 'NY'
  }
};

// Object constructor
const car = new Object();
car.make = 'Toyota';
car.model = 'Camry';
car.year = 2020;
```

### Accessing Object Properties

Object properties can be accessed using dot notation or bracket notation.

```javascript
console.log(person.name); // Output: John Doe
console.log(person['age']); // Output: 30

const property = 'address';
console.log(person[property].city); // Output: New York
```

### Modifying Object Properties

Object properties can be modified by assigning a new value to them.

```javascript
person.age = 35;
person['address'].city = 'Los Angeles';
```

### Adding and Deleting Object Properties

New properties can be added to an object by assigning a value to a new key.

```javascript
person.email = 'john.doe@example.com';
```

Properties can be deleted using the `delete` keyword.

```javascript
delete person.email;
```

## Arrays

An array is an ordered list of values, where each value is assigned a numeric index starting from 0. Arrays are used to store multiple values of the same type or different types.

### Creating an Array

Arrays can be created using array literal notation or the `Array` constructor.

```javascript
// Array literal notation
const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];

// Array constructor
const numbers = new Array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
```

### Accessing Array Elements

Array elements can be accessed using their index.

```javascript
console.log(fruits[0]); // Output: apple
console.log(numbers[2]); // Output: 3
```

### Modifying Array Elements

Array elements can be modified by assigning a new value to them.

```javascript
fruits[1] = 'grape';
numbers[3] = 10;
```

### Adding and Removing Array Elements

New elements can be added to an array using the `push()` method.

```javascript
fruits.push('mango');
```

Elements can be removed from an array using the `pop()` method.

```javascript
fruits.pop();
```

## Conclusion

Objects and arrays are fundamental data structures in JavaScript that allow you to store and manipulate data in different ways. Understanding how to work with objects and arrays is essential for building complex applications.
