# Creating HTTP Servers and REST APIs

In this section, we will learn how to create HTTP servers in Node.js using the built-in `http` module. We will also explore how to build RESTful APIs using Express.js, a popular web framework for Node.js.

## Introduction to HTTP Servers

In this section, we will provide an overview of HTTP servers and their role in web development. We will cover the basics of the HTTP protocol and how it works.

## Creating an HTTP Server with the `http` Module

In this section, we will dive into the `http` module in Node.js and learn how to create a basic HTTP server. We will cover topics such as listening for incoming requests, handling different HTTP methods, and sending responses.

## Routing and Handling Requests

In this section, we will explore how to handle different routes and requests in an HTTP server. We will learn how to use the `url` module to parse request URLs and how to define routes for different endpoints.

## Middleware in Express.js

In this section, we will introduce Express.js, a powerful web framework for Node.js. We will learn how to use middleware functions in Express.js to handle common tasks such as logging, parsing request bodies, and handling errors.

## Building RESTful APIs

In this section, we will focus on building RESTful APIs using Express.js. We will learn how to define routes for different CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and how to handle request parameters and query strings.

## REST API Design Principles and Best Practices

In this section, we will discuss the design principles and best practices for building RESTful APIs. We will cover topics such as resource naming, versioning, pagination, error handling, and authentication.
