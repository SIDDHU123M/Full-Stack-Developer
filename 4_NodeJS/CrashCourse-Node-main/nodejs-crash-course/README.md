## Overview

Node.js is a powerful JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows you to run JavaScript code on the server-side, enabling you to build scalable and high-performance applications. Some of the core features of Node.js include:

- Asynchronous programming model: Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it highly efficient for handling concurrent requests.
- Extensive module ecosystem: Node.js has a vast collection of modules available through npm, the Node Package Manager, which allows you to easily add functionality to your applications.
- Fast and scalable: Node.js is built on the V8 JavaScript engine, which provides excellent performance and scalability for handling large-scale applications.
- Full-stack JavaScript development: With Node.js, you can use JavaScript both on the server-side and client-side, enabling full-stack JavaScript development.

## Installation and Setup

To get started with Node.js, follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js: Visit the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org) and download the latest version of Node.js for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions provided.

2. Verify the installation: Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to check if Node.js is installed correctly:

   ```shell
   node --version
   ```

   This should display the version number of Node.js installed on your system.

3. Set up Node Version Manager (NVM) (optional): NVM allows you to manage multiple versions of Node.js on your system. It is useful when working on projects that require different Node.js versions. Follow the instructions provided in the NVM documentation (https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install and set up NVM.

4. Create a new project directory: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create your Node.js project.

5. Initialize a new Node.js project: Run the following command to initialize a new Node.js project and create a `package.json` file:

   ```shell
   npm init
   ```

   Follow the prompts to provide information about your project.

6. Install dependencies: As you progress through the course, you may need to install additional dependencies for your projects. Use the following command to install dependencies listed in the `package.json` file:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

   This will install all the dependencies specified in the `package.json` file.

That's it! You're now ready to dive into the Node.js Crash Course. Start with the first chapter and enjoy learning Node.js!
