# Setting Up Node.js Environment

This lesson will guide you through the process of setting up your Node.js environment. 

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js: [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

## Steps

Follow these steps to set up your Node.js environment:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Check if Node.js is installed by running the following command:
   ```
   node --version
   ```
   If Node.js is installed, you will see the version number. If not, please install Node.js using the link provided above.
3. Check if npm (Node Package Manager) is installed by running the following command:
   ```
   npm --version
   ```
   If npm is installed, you will see the version number. If not, npm is automatically installed with Node.js, so you should have it already.
4. Create a new directory for your Node.js project:
   ```
   mkdir my-node-project
   ```
5. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd my-node-project
   ```
6. Initialize a new Node.js project by running the following command:
   ```
   npm init
   ```
   This will create a `package.json` file that will store information about your project and its dependencies.
7. Install any required dependencies for your project using npm. For example, to install the Express.js framework, run the following command:
   ```
   npm install express
   ```
   This will install the Express.js package and add it as a dependency in your `package.json` file.
8. You are now ready to start developing your Node.js application!

## Conclusion

In this lesson, you learned how to set up your Node.js environment. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed, create a new project directory, initialize a new Node.js project, and install any required dependencies using npm. Happy coding!
