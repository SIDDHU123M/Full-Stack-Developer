# REST API Project

This is the README file for the REST API project.

## Description

The REST API project is a simple API built using Node.js and Express.js. It provides endpoints for performing CRUD operations on a database.

## Installation

To install and run the REST API project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `rest_api` directory.
3. Run the command `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
4. Run the command `npm start` to start the server.

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can use tools like Postman or cURL to send HTTP requests to the API endpoints. Here are some example requests:

- GET /api/users: Get a list of all users.
- POST /api/users: Create a new user.
- GET /api/users/:id: Get a specific user by ID.
- PUT /api/users/:id: Update a specific user by ID.
- DELETE /api/users/:id: Delete a specific user by ID.

Make sure to replace `:id` with the actual ID of the user you want to retrieve, update, or delete.
