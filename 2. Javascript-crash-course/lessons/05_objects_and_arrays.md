# Objects and Arrays

In JavaScript, objects and arrays are fundamental data structures that allow you to store and manipulate collections of values. Understanding how to work with objects and arrays is essential for full-stack development. In this lesson, we will cover the basics of objects and arrays, including creating, accessing, and manipulating their contents.

## Objects

An object in JavaScript is an unordered collection of key-value pairs, where each key is a string (or symbol) and each value can be of any data type. Objects are useful for representing real-world entities and organizing related data.

### Creating Objects

There are two common ways to create objects in JavaScript: object literals and the `Object` constructor.

#### Object Literals

The simplest way to create an object is by using object literals. An object literal is a comma-separated list of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces `{}`.

```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  age: 30,
  email: 'john@example.com',
};
```

In the above example, we created an object `person` with three properties: `name`, `age`, and `email`. The property names are strings, and the values can be of any data type.

#### Object Constructor

Another way to create objects is by using the `Object` constructor. The `Object` constructor can be called with or without the `new` keyword.

```javascript
const person = new Object();
person.name = 'John Doe';
person.age = 30;
person.email = 'john@example.com';
```

In the above example, we created an empty object `person` using the `Object` constructor and then added properties to it using dot notation.

### Accessing Object Properties

You can access object properties using dot notation or bracket notation.

```javascript
console.log(person.name); // Output: John Doe
console.log(person['age']); // Output: 30
```

In the above example, we accessed the `name` property using dot notation and the `age` property using bracket notation.

### Modifying Object Properties

You can modify object properties by assigning new values to them.

```javascript
person.name = 'Jane Smith';
person.age = 35;
```

In the above example, we modified the `name` and `age` properties of the `person` object.

### Object Methods

In addition to properties, objects can also have methods, which are functions that are associated with the object.

```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  age: 30,
  email: 'john@example.com',
  sayHello: function() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
  },
};
```

In the above example, we added a `sayHello` method to the `person` object. The `sayHello` method logs a greeting message using the `name` property of the object.

### Iterating Over Object Properties

To iterate over the properties of an object, you can use a `for...in` loop.

```javascript
for (let key in person) {
  console.log(`${key}: ${person[key]}`);
}
```

In the above example, we used a `for...in` loop to iterate over the properties of the `person` object and log each property and its value.

## Arrays

An array in JavaScript is an ordered collection of values. Arrays are useful for storing and manipulating lists of items.

### Creating Arrays

You can create an array by enclosing a comma-separated list of values in square brackets `[]`.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

In the above example, we created an array `numbers` with five elements.

### Accessing Array Elements

You can access array elements using zero-based indexing.

```javascript
console.log(numbers[0]); // Output: 1
console.log(numbers[2]); // Output: 3
```

In the above example, we accessed the first and third elements of the `numbers` array.

### Modifying Array Elements

You can modify array elements by assigning new values to them.

```javascript
numbers[0] = 10;
numbers[2] = 30;
```

In the above example, we modified the first and third elements of the `numbers` array.

### Array Methods

Arrays have built-in methods that allow you to perform various operations on the array.

```javascript
const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];

console.log(fruits.length); // Output: 3

fruits.push('grape');
console.log(fruits); // Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'grape']

fruits.pop();
console.log(fruits); // Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']
```

In the above example, we used the `length` property to get the number of elements in the `fruits` array. We also used the `push` method to add an element to the end of the array and the `pop` method to remove the last element from the array.

### Iterating Over Array Elements

To iterate over the elements of an array, you can use a `for` loop or array methods like `forEach`.

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < fruits.length; i++) {
  console.log(fruits[i]);
}

fruits.forEach(function(fruit) {
  console.log(fruit);
});
```

In the above example, we used a `for` loop and the `forEach` method to iterate over the elements of the `fruits` array and log each element.

## Exercises

1. Create an object `car` with properties `make`, `model`, and `year`. Log the values of these properties to the console.

2. Create an array `fruits` with three elements: `apple`, `banana`, and `orange`. Log the length of the array to the console.

3. Add a new fruit `grape` to the `fruits` array. Log the updated array to the console.

4. Modify the second element of the `fruits` array to `kiwi`. Log the updated array to the console.

5. Create a method `getFullName` in the `person` object that returns the full name of the person. Test the method by calling it and logging the result to the console.

6. Iterate over the properties of the `person` object using a `for...in` loop and log each property and its value to the console.
